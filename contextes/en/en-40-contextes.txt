   Chairwoman of the inquiry, former judge Baroness Hallett, said the UK's
   response could be summarised as "too little, too late".

   The report looks at whether lockdowns were timely and reasonable, and
   what impact rule-breaking at the heart of government had on public
   confidence.

   Here are some of the main findings.

Lockdown could have been avoided completely

   The report says lockdown could have been avoided if steps such as
   social distancing and isolating those with symptoms along with members
   of their household had been introduced earlier than mid-March 2020.

   But by the time ministers took action it was already too late and a
   lockdown was inevitable, it says.

   By the end of January 2020 it "should have been clear that the virus
   posed a serious and immediate threat", while February 2020 was "a lost
   month" and the lack of urgency overall in government was "inexcusable",
   the inquiry found.

   Voluntary measures were brought in on 16 March 2020, followed by the
   full stay-at home lockdown seven days later.

But lockdown a week earlier could have saved thousands of lives

   Bringing in lockdown a week earlier on 16 March would have meant 23,000
   fewer deaths in England in the first wave, modelling suggests. This
   would have equated to 48% fewer deaths in the first wave.

   But the report does not suggest the overall death toll for the pandemic
   â 227,000 in the UK by the time it was declared over in 2023 â would
   have been reduced by an earlier lockdown.

   That is very difficult to tell, as it depends on a variety of other
   factors that could have reduced or increased the number of deaths as
   the pandemic progressed.

   Dominic Cummings was Johnson's chief adviser until he resigned in
   November 2020

   The then-PM Johnson is also criticised for excessive optimism in the
   face of the looming pandemic and "oscillation" on key lockdown
   decisions.

   The report says Johnson "should have appreciated sooner that this was
   an emergency that required prime ministerial leadership to inject

   Meanwhile, his health secretary, Matt Hancock, is accused by Baroness
   Hallett of not being "candid" enough about the UK's ability to deal
   with the virus.

Lockdowns left 'lasting scars'

   While the lockdowns of 2020 and 2021 undoubtedly saved lives, they also
   "left lasting scars on society and the economy, brought ordinary
   childhood to a halt, delayed the diagnosis and treatment of other
   health issues and exacerbated societal inequalities", it says.

   increased the risk that people wouldn't stick to the measures being put
   in place.

   It lists events such as Cummings' trip to Durham and Barnard Castle in
   March 2020; two visits to a second home during lockdown by the chief
   medical officer for Scotland, Dr Catherine Calderwood; and visits to
   the home of scientific adviser Prof Neil Ferguson by a woman with whom
   he was in relationship during lockdown.

   By the time details of parties and social events in Downing Street
   emerged in November 2021, there was a "public outcry", the report says.

   lacked urgency in their response, the devolved administrations were
   overly reliant on the UK government to lead the response.

   The four nations then differed in their strategy for exiting the first
   national lockdown, with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland adopting a
   more cautious approach â but this was undermined by no restrictions on
   travel from England, where many restrictions had been eased.

   The report finds that in Autumn 2020, Holyrood was the only government
   to learn lessons from the first lockdown, and introduced tough,
   locally-targeted measures which helped avoid the need for a nationwide
   lockdown.

   On the other hand, decision-making in Northern Ireland was described as
   "chaotic", while the Welsh government's approach resulted in the
   highest age-standardised mortality rate of the four nations between

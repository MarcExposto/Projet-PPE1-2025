   During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of
   non-pharmaceutical interventions, particularly lockdowns (encompassing
   stay-at-home orders, curfews, quarantines, cordons sanitaires and
   similar societal restrictions), were implemented in numerous countries
   and territories around the world.^[1] By April 2020, about half of the
   world's population was under some form of lockdown, with more than
   3.9 billion people in more than 90 countries or territories having been
   asked or ordered to stay at home by their governments.^[2]

   In addition to the health effects of lockdown restrictions,^[3]
   researchers had found the lockdowns may have reduced crime and violence
   by armed non-state actors, such as the Islamic State, and other
   terrorist groups.^[4] In addition, lockdowns had increased the uptake
   of telecommuting, reduced airborne pollution, and increased adoption of
   digital payment systems.

   Research has also documented profound negative economic impacts, in
   addition to worsened school academic performance^[5] and negative
   mental health consequences.^[6]

   Lockdowns were met with major protests around the world.

Efficacy

   [edit]

   Several researchers, from modeling and demonstrated examples, have
   concluded that lockdowns were somewhat effective at reducing the spread
   of, and deaths caused by,
   COVID-19.^[7]^[8]^[9]^[10]^[11]^[12]^[13]^[14]^[15]^[non-primary source
   needed] Lockdowns are thought to be most effective at containing or
   preventing COVID-19 community transmission, healthcare costs and deaths
   when implemented earlier, with greater stringency, and when not lifted
   too early.^[16]^[17]^[18]^[19]^[20]

   A study investigating the spread based on studies of the most common
   symptoms such as loss of taste and smell in France, Italy and the UK
   showed a marked decrease in new symptoms just a few days after the
   start of confinement on the countries (Italy and France) with the
   strongest lockdowns.^[21] Modelling on the United States pandemic
   suggested "the pandemic would have been almost completely suppressed
   from significantly taking off if the lockdown measures were implemented
   two weeks earlier" and that the second wave would have been less severe
   had the lockdown lasted another two weeks.^[16]

   The stringent lockdown in Hubei in early 2020 proved effective at
   controlling the COVID-19 outbreak in China.^[14]^[22] The relatively
   high number of cases and deaths in Sweden, which kept much of its
   society open during the pandemic, when compared to its neighbours with
   comparable demographics Norway, Denmark and Finland that did enforce
   lockdowns, is thought to be at least partly attributable to this
   difference in policy.^[23]^[24]^[25]^[26]^[27]^[28]^[29] Similarly,
   modelling on Australian data concluded that achieving zero community
   transmission through a strict lockdown lowers healthcare and economic
   costs compared to less stringent measures that allow transmission to
   continue, and warned that early relaxation of restrictions have greater
   costs.^[18]^[19] This "zero community transmission" approach was
   adopted in Australia, and a strict four-month lockdown in the state of
   Victoria during an outbreak in Melbourne, combined with other measures,
   averted a wider outbreak in the country in 2020.^[30] New Zealand and
   Vietnam also adopted a "Zero-COVID" strategy throughout 2020 that
   included targeted lockdowns.^[31]^[32] A natural experiment study finds
   that the partial lockdown in Kyrgyzstan (with curfews) was just as
   effective as the full lockdown in Kazakhstan (with many business
   closures) at reducing the spread of the virus.^[33]

   The emergence of the highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant in
   2021 led some commentators to suggest that although lockdowns continue
   to reduce the spread of COVID-19, they have become less effective at
   containing it. Lockdowns in Australia and Vietnam in response to Delta
   outbreaks proved less effective at containment than previous lockdowns
   were against the spread of other variants.^[34]^[35]^[36]

Voluntary versus mandatory restrictions

   One study led by an economist at the University of Chicago found that
   involuntary lockdowns had little impact, with voluntary distancing
   making up nearly 90% of the fall in consumer traffic as people feared
   the virus itself.^[37] Similarly, a National Bureau of Economic
   Research study found stay-at-home orders increased staying at home by
   just 5-10%.^[38] Another study from Yale University found that most
--

   Some research has also found that an "advisory" approach is not
   adequate to control COVID-19 outbreaks. An analysis of an outbreak in
   northern Italy found that an effective reduction in community
   transmission occurred during a strict national lockdown, and that
   earlier less stringent measures were ineffective at reducing mobility
   to a level low enough to reduce the spread of COVID-19.^[48]

   Since the beginning of the pandemic, Google has consistently collected
--

   During the early stages of the pandemic in Europe and the United
   States, statistical modeling which advised that restrictions were
   helpful to prevent a large number of deaths were used as the basis for
   lockdowns.^[54] This includes an Imperial College projection, led by
   epidemiologist Neil Ferguson.^[55] Despite some criticisms, academics
   defended the Imperial projection as fundamentally sound, while
   admitting the code was "a buggy mess".^[56] Retrospective evaluation of
   lockdowns and computer modeling has verified that they have
   significantly contributed to reducing mortality and morbidity from
   COVID-19.^[57]

   A notable opponent of lockdowns has included Sweden's state
   epidemiologist Anders Tegnell, who has frequently criticised the
   strategy.^[58]^[59] The Swedish government's approach has included
   minimal restrictions and has been controversial in part due to the
   relatively high death toll due to widespread transmission.^[60]^[61]
   However, the Swedish government began considering enacting a lockdown
   in early 2021.^[62]^[63]

   While arguing in August 2020 for the need for further lockdowns in the
   United States, physicians Ranu Dhillon and Abraar Karan argued for
   "smarter lockdowns" that impose restrictions on areas with high levels
   of transmission, and to increase support to vulnerable populations in
   these locations to offset the economic costs.^[64]

   The lockdowns had multiple effects on people's everyday lives. Some of
   these were direct effects, such as cancelling or postponing a social
   event, and others had indirect effects, such as losing a sense of
   identity.^[68] For example, teachers often derive meaning and a sense
   of life purpose from teaching, but the schools were closed, which

   Some researchers have noted that COVID-19 pandemic restrictions have
   come with mental health costs, compounded by those caused by the
   COVID-19 pandemic itself.^[10]^[75]^[76]^[77]^[78] Systematic reviews
   and meta-analyses indicate that the COVID-19 lockdowns were associated
   with increased rates of depression, anxiety, psychological distress,
   and a decline in health-related quality of life among children and
   adolescents, largely driven by school closures, social isolation, and
   disrupted routines.^[79] A rapid review published in the Lancet found
   that quarantine and lockdown measures were frequently associated with
   adverse psychological effects. Factors such as prolonged quarantine
   restrictions and inadequate information contributed to anxiety and
   post-traumatic stress symptoms.^[6]

   Lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic also led to strained
   relationships, increased cyberbullying, and physical consequences like
   abuse, accidental poisonings, and foreign object injuries.^[80]
   Pandemic policies were associated with increased depressive symptoms,
   decreased physical activity, poorer nutrition, reduced emergency
--

   UN Women warned in an April 2020 report that COVID-19 pandemic
   restrictions exacerbate gender inequalities and have led to an increase
   in domestic violence.^[85] Many women (and men), were being forced to
   'lockdown' at home with their abusers at the same time that services to
   support survivors are being disrupted or made inaccessible.^[86] For
   instance, in France there was around a 30% spike in cases of violence
   against women since the lockdown in March 2020.^[85]

   Telehealth had an important role to allow physicians not to miss the
   follow-up of patients with different chronic diseases and potentially
   helped to contain SARS-CoV-2 spreading among both patients and
   healthcare providers.^[87]

   In late 2023, former Director of the National Institutes of Health (in
   the United States) Francis Collins went viral online amongst critics of
   the lockdown response when he discussed the lack of weight that public
   health authorities had given to the potential downsides of the lockdown
   measures when they were formulating the official response to
   COVID-19.^[88]

Related to economic impacts

   Some economists supported increased government funding for mitigation
   efforts, even at the cost of tolerating a very large economic
   contraction.^[89] They agreed that lockdowns should continue until the
   threat of resurgence has declined, even when considering only the
   economic impact.^[90] There was a general agreement, at least in some
   economic circles, that "severe lockdowns -- including closing
   non-essential businesses and strict limitations on people's movement --
   are likely to be better for the economy in the medium term than less
   aggressive measures".^[91]

   Both the World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Health Organization
   (WHO) have published statements noting the impact of the lockdowns on
   livelihoods and food security, and David Nabarro, WHO Special Envoy on
   COVID-19 stated in October 2020 that "lockdowns just have one
   consequence that you must never ever belittle, and that is making poor
   people an awful lot poorer".^[92]^[93]^[94]

Protests

   There have also been a number of protests worldwide in opposition to
   lockdowns, including in the United Kingdom, the United States,
   Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, Canada and New Zealand. The
   motivations for and sizes of these protests have varied. Some have been
   spurred by the economic and social impacts of lockdowns, but have also
   been associated with misinformation related to the pandemic, conspiracy
   theories and anti-vaccination.^[95]^[96]

       accepted definition of what constitutes a lockdown.

   In the table, pandemic lockdowns are defined as the shutdown of parts
   of the economy,^[531] due to non-pharmaceutical anti-pandemic measures
   and enforceable by law like:
     * Closing of schools and kindergartens
     * Closing of non-essential shops (shops and stores apart from food,
--
     * Any measures which are voluntary rather than enforceable by law

   The pandemic resulted in the largest number of shutdowns worldwide at
   the same time in history.^[533] By 26 March, 1.7 billion people
   worldwide were under some form of lockdown,^[534] which increased to
   3.9 billion people by the first week of April - more than half of the
   world's population.^[535]^[536] Lockdowns affected 93% of workers
   worldwide. 30% lived in nations with complete workplace closures, save
   for critical businesses, and 42% in countries with partial closures.
   Nearly 20% lived in nations with recommended but not compulsory
   workplace shutdown.^[537]

   bring in tough measures. Restrictions on travel between and activity
   within nations were of varying stringency.^[539]

   By mid April, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the
   population, were under some form of lockdown in the United
   States,^[540] with around 100 million in the Philippines^[541] and
   about 59 million in South Africa,^[542] while around 1.3 billion were
   under lockdown in India, which was the largest of all
   lockdowns.^[543]^[544]

   By the end of April, around 300 million people were under lockdown in
   various countries of Europe, including but not limited to Italy, Spain,
   France, and the United Kingdom; while around 200 million people were
   under lockdown in Latin America.^[541] In Germany, 35% of workers
   worked from home in addition to their regular on-site duties, while 26%
   worked from home exclusively.^[545]

   This section is an excerpt from COVID-19 lockdowns by country.[edit]

   Countries and territories around the world enforced lockdowns of
   varying stringency in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

   Some included total movement control while others enforced restrictions
   based on time. In many cases, only essential businesses were allowed to
   remain open. Schools, universities and colleges closed either on a
   nationwide or local basis in 63 countries, affecting approximately 47
   percent of the world's student population.^[546]^[547]

   Beginning with the first lockdown in China's Hubei province^[548] and
   nationwide in Italy in March 2020, lockdowns continued to be
   implemented in many countries throughout 2020 and 2021. On 24 March
   2020, the entire 1.3 billion population of India was ordered to stay at
   home during its lockdown, making it the largest of the pandemic.^[549]
   The world's longest continuous lockdown lasting 234 days took place in
   Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 2020. As of October 2021, the city of

   most cumulative days in lockdown over separate periods, although
   measures varied between these countries.^[550]^[551]

Strategies for managing lockdown

   Reading time: 3 min

   Coping with lockdown means adapting daily life to these new
   circumstances. This has a direct impact on different emotional aspects,
   restructuring and adapting new spaces, and suddenly absorbing new
   situations that are difficult to manage, amongst others.

--
   Accept the situation in order to maintain a good state of mind and to
   be calmer.

   Remember the reasons behind the lockdown.
   Person with crossed-out TV, radio and mobile phone

   Avoid excessive consumption of information. Evaluate it and contrast
   it.
--
   Do enjoyable and relaxing activities that don't require going anywhere.

Working remotely

   Lockdown has meant many people have to work from home and must dedicate
   a space in their house to this. As far as is possible, professionals
   recommend:
   A living room with sofa, table and computer

--
   Patient talking to healthcare staff

   And, if necessary, to consult a mental health professional.

Lockdown and childhood

   Children have also had to reorganise their daily school,
   extracurricular activity and leisure routines. To help them cope with
   lockdown, you are advised to:
   Child asking questions to an adult

   Be attentive, answer children's questions and keep them well-informed.
   Adult who listens to and understands a child's concerns
--
   Let them participate in family decisions as much as possible.
   Two adults talking and communicating with a child

   Explain what the family situation (work and schedules) will be like
   during lockdown.
   Hand washing

   Help them to understand and follow safety measures.

   If they want to, allow children to participate in alternative ways of
   saying goodbye to family members during lockdown.

   Allow children to use electronic devices reasonably.

   deployed to the general public beginning in December 2020, made
   available through government and international programmes such as
   COVAX, aiming to provide vaccine equity. Treatments include novel
   antiviral drugs and symptom control. Common mitigation measures during
   the public health emergency included travel restrictions, lockdowns,
   business restrictions and closures, workplace hazard controls, mask
   mandates, quarantines, testing systems, and contact tracing of the
   infected.

   Many countries attempted to slow or stop the spread of COVID-19 by
   recommending, mandating or prohibiting behaviour changes, while others
   relied primarily on providing information. Measures ranged from public
   advisories to stringent lockdowns. Outbreak control strategies are
   divided into elimination and mitigation. Experts differentiate between
   elimination strategies (known as "zero-COVID") that aim to completely
   stop the spread of the virus within the community,^[168] and mitigation
   strategies (commonly known as "flattening the curve") that attempt to
--
   no longer contagious. Screening is the starting point for containment.
   Screening is done by checking for symptoms to identify infected
   individuals, who can then be isolated or offered treatment.^[172] The
   zero-COVID strategy involves using public health measures such as
   contact tracing, mass testing, border quarantine, lockdowns, and
   mitigation software to stop community transmission of COVID-19 as soon
   as it is detected, with the goal of getting the area back to zero
   detected infections and resuming normal economic and social
   activities.^[168]^[173] Successful containment or suppression reduces

   More drastic actions, such as quarantining entire populations and
   strict travel bans have been attempted in various jurisdictions.^[177]
   The Chinese and Australian government approaches have included many
   lockdowns and are widely considered the most strict. The New Zealand
   government response included the most severe travel restrictions. As
   part of its K-Quarantine programme, South Korea introduced mass
   screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements
   of infected individuals. The Singaporean government's response included
   so-called "circuit breaker lockdowns" and financial support for those
   affected while also imposing large fines for those who broke
   quarantine.^[178]

   February had dropped 90 per cent. Director-General Tedros said this was
   "cause for optimism".^[251] On 3 December, the WHO indicated that, "at
   least 90% of the world's population has some level of immunity to
   Sars-CoV-2".^[252] In early December, China began lifting some of its
   most stringent lockdown measures. Subsequent data from China's health
   authorities revealed that 248 million people, nearly 18 per cent of its
   population, had been infected in the first 20 days of that month.^[253]

Responses

   Main articles: COVID-19 lockdowns, COVID-19 pandemic by country and
   territory, and National responses to the COVID-19 pandemic

   National reactions ranged from strict lockdowns to public education
   campaigns.^[267] WHO recommended that curfews and lockdowns should be
   short-term measures to reorganise, regroup, rebalance resources, and
   protect the health care system.^[268] As of 26 March 2020, 1.7 billion
   people worldwide were under some form of lockdown.^[269] This increased
   to 3.9 billion people by the first week of Aprilâmore than half the
   world's population.^[270]^[271]

   In several countries, protests rose against restrictions such as
   lockdowns. A February 2021 study found that protests against
   restrictions were likely to directly increase the spread of the
   virus.^[272]

   China opted for containment, instituting strict lockdowns to eliminate
   viral spread.^[275]^[276] The vaccines distributed in China included
   the BIBP, WIBP, and CoronaVac.^[277] It was reported on 11 December
   2021, that China had vaccinated 1.162 billion of its citizens, or 82.5%
   of the total population of the country against COVID-19.^[278] China's
   large-scale adoption of zero-COVID had largely contained the first
   waves of infections of the disease.^[275]^[279]^[280] When the waves of
   infections due to the Omicron variant followed, China was almost alone
   in pursuing the strategy of zero-Covid to combat the spread of the
   virus in 2022.^[281] Lockdown continued to be employed in November to
   combat a new wave of cases;^[282]^[283] however, protests erupted in
   cities across China over the country's stringent measures,^[284]^[285]
   and in December that year, the country relaxed its zero-COVID
   policy.^[286] On 20 December 2022, the Chinese State Council narrowed

   hospitals reported being overwhelmed with cases following the abrupt

   The first case in India was reported on 30 January 2020. India ordered
   a nationwide lockdown starting 24 March 2020,^[290] with a phased
   unlock beginning 1 June 2020. Six cities accounted for around half of
   reported casesâMumbai, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Pune and
   Kolkata.^[291] Post-lockdown, the Government of India introduced a
   contact tracking app called Aarogya Setu to help authorities manage
   contact tracing and vaccine distribution.^[292] India's vaccination
   programme was considered to be the world's largest and most successful
   with over 90% of citizens getting the first dose and another 65%

   across the continent. By 17 March 2020, every country in Europe had
   confirmed a case,^[317] and all had reported at least one death, with
   the exception of Vatican City. Italy was the first European nation to
   experience a major outbreak in early 2020, becoming the first country
   worldwide to introduce a national lockdown.^[318] By 13 March 2020, the
   WHO declared Europe the epicentre of the pandemic^[319]^[320] and it
   remained so until the WHO announced it had been overtaken by South
   America on 22 May.^[321] By 18 March 2020, more than 250 million people
   were in lockdown in Europe.^[322] Despite deployment of COVID-19
   vaccines, Europe became the pandemic's epicentre once again in late
   2021.^[323]^[324]

   The Italian outbreak began on 31 January 2020, when two Chinese

   ordered to remain at home for the next 14 days.^[336] The number of
   cases increased again in July in a number of cities including
   Barcelona, Zaragoza and Madrid, which led to reimposition of some
   restrictions but no national lockdown.^[337]^[338]^[339]^[340] By
   September 2021, Spain was one of the countries with the highest
   percentage of its population vaccinated (76% fully vaccinated and 79%
   with the first dose).^[341] Italy is ranked second at 75%.^[341]

   Sweden differed from most other European countries in that it mostly
   remained open.^[342] Per the Swedish constitution, the Public Health
   Agency of Sweden has autonomy that prevents political interference and
   the agency favoured remaining open. The Swedish strategy focused on
   longer-term measures, based on the assumption that after lockdown the
   virus would resume spreading, with the same result.^[343]^[344] By the
   end of June, Sweden no longer had excess mortality.^[345]

   690 million people lacked food security in 2019.^[555] Food access fell
   â driven by falling incomes, lost remittances, and disruptions to food
   production.^[556] In some cases, food prices rose.^[553]^[555] The
   pandemic and its accompanying lockdowns and travel restrictions slowed
   movement of food aid. According to the WHO, 811 million people were
   undernourished in 2020, "likely related to the fallout of
   COVID-19".^[557]^[437]

   and climate as a result of reduced human activity. During the
   "anthropause", fossil fuel use decreased, resource consumption
   declined, and waste disposal improved, generating less pollution.^[584]
   Planned air travel and vehicle transportation declined. In China,
   lockdowns and other measures resulted in a 26% decrease in coal
   consumption, and a 50% reduction in nitrogen oxides
   emissions.^[584]^[585]^[586]

   In 2020, a worldwide study on mammalian wildlife responses to human
   presence during COVID lockdowns found complex patterns of animal
   behaviour. Carnivores were generally less active when humans were
   around, while herbivores in developed areas were more active. Among
   other findings, this suggested that herbivores may view humans as a
   shield against predators, highlighting the importance of location and

   Despite strong economic rebounds following the initial lockdowns in

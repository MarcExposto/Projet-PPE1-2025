Sheriff's Office Reports 17 People Dead In South Florida High School Shooting

   When Patterson got to the hospital, there was a security guard blocking
   the door. The facility was on lockdown after receiving several victims
   from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Earlier that day, a gunman
   had opened fire at the school â killing 17 people and injuring another

   Patterson was one of dozens of family members and friends waiting
   outside the hospital to see loved ones who were being treated for

   "Sometimes, we stay in these elevated lockdown stages longer than we
   need to," he said.

   Hospitals are also lining up extra staff who they can call in
   specifically to deal with crowds: the people who are there because of
   an emergency and the visitors who would've been there anyway.

   Still, hospital security experts defend lockdowns as an important
   precautionary measure.

   As painful as lockdowns can be for family members, "our first and
   foremost responsibility is treating the patients, and that overrides
   everything," said Bryan Margeson, corporate security manager for

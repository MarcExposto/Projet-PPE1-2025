   The world has largely moved on from Covid - except for China, where
   towns and cities are still shut down overnight.
--
   even the world - was hoping for a hint of relaxation. But Mr Xi, who is
   set to be handed a historic third term to lead the Party, said that the
   government would not "waver" in its commitment to record zero cases.

   Driven by Mr Xi's approval, China's lockdowns have been incessant,
   unpredictable and hellish by most accounts. They have sparked food
   shortages, crippled healthcare access, hit the economy hard and even
   spurred rare signs of protest.

   down 152 prefecture-level cities, affecting a population of more than
   280 million. But 114 of those have been locked down just since August,
   as the Party Congress approached.

   Beijing is the only major city to have avoided a full lockdown so far.
   Residents half-jokingly observe that the capital has managed this by
   locking down the rest of the country when needed. However on Thursday
   some housing estates and shopping centres in Beijing were being locked
   down after a steep rise in cases.

   BBC gathered data starting in March because that's when China's fourth
   phase of Covid control measures kicked off - comparing lockdowns across
   phases is harder because official language changes, skewing definitions
   and therefore, the corresponding data.

   And China's bureaucrats have certainly found inventive new ways to
   describe lockdowns. The measures had become so controversial and
   dreaded that confusing official-speak was one way to make them more
   palatable.

   So they used phrases like "stasis management", "at-home stillness" or
   to be clearer, "stillness throughout the whole region" or "stop all
   unnecessary movement".

   Then came "temporary societal control", which authorities said was not
   a "lockdown" but reduced movement that somehow would not affect the
   "normal order of production and life". And yet "the public was asked
   not to go out unless necessary".

   "Enclosed management" was another new phrase invented in the southern
   province of Guangdong. It means that the village, district or
   residential compound is enclosed, with checkpoints at entrances and
   exits. People and vehicles are allowed to enter and leave with passes.
   People who do not live or work in the enclosed area are not allowed to
   enter. But, residents were told, it's not a lockdown.

   When track-and-trace methods started to grate, eager officials came up
   with an alternative: "temporal and spatial overlapper". The
   sci-fi-inspired phrase refers to someone whose location, tracked by

   Dynamic because the idea is that it's not just about locking down
   entire cities and towns but about responding more dynamically depending
   on what the situation requires. But on the ground, it just looks and
   feels like a series of endless lockdowns.

   The year began with the tourist hub of Xi'an, home to 13 million, being
   shut down for a month. Then in March, a lockdown was announced in
   Shanghai. It was meant to last less than a week, but its 25 million
   residents stayed home for two months. In September, residents in locked
   down Chengdu found themselves trapped in their apartments during an
   earthquake. Elsewhere, rescue workers were required to do a Covid test

   Chengdu was among several cities where a lockdown caused food shortages

   That same month, hundreds of thousands of people in two cities in
   Shanxi faced a lockdown without a single case being reported: officials
   said it was to "contain the risk from outside". A local party leader
   vowed to protect the area "to welcome the 20th Party Congress with
   excellent results".

Pleasing Mr Xi

   Beijing has repeatedly insisted that "dynamic zero" means local
   authorities must not resort to a "one size fits all" approach of full
   lockdowns and mass testing.

   But there appears to be a discrepancy between that diktat and what's
   actually happening in towns and cities across China. Several lockdowns
   announced by local officials were, in fact, missing from Beijing's
   daily announcements in March and April - including one in Shenzhen
   which confined 17 million to their homes for a week.

   It's possible central government officials did not want to encourage
   total lockdowns by drawing attention to them, while local officials
   preferred to use them to control outbreaks swiftly.

   Experts also say China's bureaucracy is far more centralised under Mr
   Xi - it's a reversal of the decentralisation that began after China
--
   'wavering', there is little or no leeway for local governments to make
   adjustments. Indeed, to survive and get ahead, they must over-implement
   Xi's personal edicts with gusto, even if the net result is damaging."

   From April onwards, the lockdown tallies in Beijing's announcements
   matched those in local notices - around the same time Mr Xi reaffirmed
   his support for sticking to a zero-Covid approach. As the year wore on,
   more cities stopped meticulous track-and-trace and entered full
   lockdowns even if only a handful of cases were reported.

   Local officials are driven by both fear of punishment and an urge to
   display loyalty to Mr Xi, says Wu Guoguang, a senior China scholar at
   Stanford University. He was once a member of the Chinese Communist
--
   momentum to their seemingly unreasonable measures."

It's all political

   And, experts say, it's no coincidence that the lockdowns started to
   spread as the congress approached.

   "Covid is political in China," says William Hurst, professor of Chinese
   development at Cambridge University.

   But what zero-Covid has done, experts say, is project a veneer of
   control and stability as the year's biggest political event unfolds.

   Prof Hurst expects the intermittent lockdowns to last at least until
   March next year, when China's equivalent of parliament convenes to
   choose Mr Xi as president for a third time.

   "Lockdowns prevent Covid outbreaks from spreading," Prof Hurst adds.
   "But they also exert incredibly strict social control."

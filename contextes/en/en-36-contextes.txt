   All the later Covid lockdowns were âunnecessaryâ, Dominic Cummings has
   claimed. During a podcast interview with the Spectator published this
   week, the former Number 10 chief adviser said it was âunarguable that
   there never needed to be any lockdown or anything approaching a
   lockdown in Quarter 3, Quarter 4 of 2020, or in 2021â. Had the
   Government learnt more quickly from its early pandemic response, he
   suggested, âthere would never have been any need for further lockdowns
   and all of the huge economic and other damage that they did.â

   Cummings, who was working for then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson in
   Downing Street when Britain first entered a national lockdown in March
   2020, told the Spectatorâs Quite Right podcast that the initial
   measures were âvery differentâ from those which followed. âThe first
   [lockdown] was defensible in the sense of: there was no system, there
   was no testing, there was no nothing,â he said. âAll the officials who
   thought they had the worldâs best pandemic plan then suddenly admitted
   to us: âitâs all bollocks and there is no plan. We donât know what
   weâre going to do.ââ

   According to the UK Covid Inquiryâs second report, published in
   November, Cummings had warned Johnson in March 2020 that a lockdown was
   required in London to stop NHS services from âcollapsingâ within days.
   The political strategist reiterated this position during the Spectator
   interview, arguing that the NHS âwas overwhelmed in placesâ and that
   âthereâs no hypothetical world in whichâ the then-PM would have gone
   against the policies of other European governments and refused to
   impose lockdown that spring. For Cummings, âsome kind of short
   emergency measure was necessary in the circumstances.â

   Britainâs two main successes during the Covid era, in his view, âwere
   doing vaccine research faster and doing rapid testingâ. If âthe system
   had got its act together properly in summer 2020,â Cummings told the
   podcast, âyouâd have had a huge rapid-testing build-upâ and âabsolutely
   no need for lockdownsâ later that year. While he stated that it was
   âvery hard for me to see how the first one could have been avoidedâ in
   the context of the British Governmentâs inadequate preparation,
   Cummings acknowledged that âthere would definitely would have been no
   need for the first lockdownâ had advisers and ministers engaged in
   âproper pandemic planningâ.

   During the new interview, Cummings also criticised the Covid Inquiry,
   which he accused of âcompletely botch[ing] its reporting over the whole
--
   which, because itâs so bad.â The Inquiry reported last month that the
   adviser âpoisoned the atmosphereâ in 10 Downing Street during the
   response to Covid, insisting on making âkey decisions [â¦] which were
   for the prime minister to makeâ. Speaking to the Spectator, Cummings
   claimed that âall the later lockdowns were unnecessary and happened
   only because the pathological system itself just kept collapsing and
   couldnât find its way out of that.â

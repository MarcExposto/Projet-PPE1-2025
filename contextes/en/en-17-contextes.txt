   Effective school safety requires comprehensive planning, clear
   protocols, and effective safety measures. In this blog, weâll explore
   the different types of lockdowns commonly used in schoolsâsoft
   lockdowns, hard lockdowns, and code red lockdownsâalong with their
   purposes and implementation guidelines. Additionally, weâll discuss
   common school safety issues and provide solutions, highlighting ALICE
   TrainingÂ® and Preparation & Response Training as proactive approaches
   to enhancing school safety.

What is a Soft Lockdown?

   A soft lockdown is a precautionary lockdown used when there is no
   immediate threat inside the school, but there may be potential risks in
   the vicinity, such as police activity or other security concerns.
   During a soft lockdown, access to the school is restricted, and
   students remain indoors, continuing their activities with additional
   security measures. School administrators and staff monitor the
   situation closely, and external doors are typically locked to limit
   access from the outside.

Benefits of Soft Lockdowns:

     * Allows students and teachers to continue classes with minimal
       disruption.

     * Prevents unauthorized access to the school while maintaining a
       calm, secure environment.

     * Enables staff to quickly upgrade to a hard lockdown if the threat
       level increases.

Soft Lockdown vs. Hard Lockdown: Key Differences

   While a soft lockdown is generally precautionary, a hard lockdown is
   implemented when there is an immediate threat to safety on school
   grounds, such as an active shooter or a violent intruder. In a hard
   lockdown, teachers and students follow strict protocols to minimize
   visibility and movement, locking doors, turning off lights, and hiding.
   This level of lockdown is designed to protect the school community from
   immediate danger.

   In summary:
     * Soft Lockdown: For potential external threats, students and staff
       remain in classrooms without high restrictions.

     * Hard Lockdown: For immediate internal threats, students and staff
       secure themselves in hidden, locked areas.

   ALICE TrainingÂ® from Navigate360 provides options-based response
   training to enhance lockdown procedures, empowering teachers and
   students with proactive strategies such as evacuation or barricading,
   depending on the situation.

What is a Code Red Lockdown?

   A code red lockdown is the highest level of lockdown, often associated
   with active shooter situations. This protocol signals an urgent threat
   to life and requires everyone to take cover, barricade themselves, and
   remain silent. Communication between law enforcement and school
   administrators is critical during a code red lockdown to ensure a
   coordinated response.

Should You Use Color Codes in Emergencies?

   Schools sometimes use color codes like code red, code yellow, or code
   blue in school to designate different types of lockdowns or
   emergencies. However, ALICE TrainingÂ® does not recommend using color
   systems for emergency alerts. It is preferable for everyone involved to
   communicate specific, descriptive information. For example, describing
   the location and appearance of an intruder helps everyone respond more

3. Enhancing Emergency Response Through ALICE TrainingÂ®

   Active shooter incidents are among the most serious threats schools may
   face, necessitating specialized training. Traditional lockdowns are not
   sufficient in the face of an active shooter. ALICE TrainingÂ® (Alert,
   Lockdown, Inform, Counter, Evacuate) offers a modern, trauma-informed
   approach to active shooter preparedness. Rather than relying solely on
   traditional lockdowns, ALICE provides options to evacuate, barricade,
   or counter depending on the situation.

   By training staff and students in ALICE strategies, schools can empower
   individuals to participate actively in their own safety, ensuring a

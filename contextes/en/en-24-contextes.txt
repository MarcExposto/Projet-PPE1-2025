   The People's Republic of China has employed mass quarantines â firstly
   of the city of Wuhan and subsequently of all of the Hubei province
   (population 55.5 million) â in the COVID-19 pandemic. After a few
   weeks, the Italian government imposed lockdowns for the entire country
   (more than 60 million people) in an attempt to stop the spread of the
   disease there. India quarantined itself from the world for a period of
   one month.^[49]^[50] Most governments around the world restricted or
   advised against all non-essential travel to and from countries and
--
   well as eliminate a vector.^[66]

   New developments for quarantine include new concepts in quarantine
   vehicles such as the ambulance bus, mobile hospitals, and
   lockdown/invacuation (inverse evacuation) procedures, as well as
   docking stations for an ambulance bus to dock to a facility under
   lockdown.^[67]

Standard quarantine practices in different countries

   [edit]
--
   During the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple governmental actors enacted
   quarantines in an effort to curb the rapid spread of the virus.
   Quarantine-like restrictions on movement included curfews and
   restrictions variously described as stay-at-home orders,
   shelter-in-place orders, shutdowns or lockdowns.^[103]

   On 26 March 2020, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under some form of
   lockdown,^[104] which increased to 2.6 billion people two days
   laterâaround a third of the world's population.^[105]^[106]

Hubei

   [edit]

   In Hubei, the origin of the epidemic, a cordon sanitaire was imposed on
   Wuhan and other major cities in China, affecting around 500 million
   people, which is unprecedented in scale in human history,^[107] to
   limit the rate of spread of the disease. The 'lockdown' of Wuhan, and
   subsequently a wider-scale 'lockdown' throughout Hubei province, began
   on 23 January 2020. At this stage, the spread of the virus in mainland
   China was running at approximately 50% growth in cases per day. On 8
   February, the daily rate of spread fell below 10%.^[108]

Italy

   in Italy

   As the outbreak spread there, beginning 22 February 2020, a cordon
   sanitaire was imposed on a group of at least 10 different
--
   virologists, epidemiologists, medical equipment, and pharmaceuticals in
   a humanitarian aid operation that Italian media dubbed "From Russia
   With Love".^[114]^[115]

   Eventually the lockdown was extended until 3 May, although starting
   from 14 April stationery shops, bookshops, and children clothing's
   shops were allowed to open.^[116]

   On 26 April 2020, the so-called "Phase 2" was announced, to start from

   persons) per day and consistently falling, it was expected that museums
   and retailers might reopen from 18 May, while hairdressers, bars and
   restaurants were expected to reopen fully on 1 June.^[119]

   Regional lockdowns were subsequently imposed as further waves of the
   virus spread through the country.^[120]

Rest of Europe

--
   non-residents because of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.

   As cases of the virus spread to and took hold in more European
   countries, many followed the earlier examples of China and Italy and
   began instituting policies of lockdown. Notable among these were
   Ireland (where schools were closed in mid March for the rest of the
   month, and limits were set on sizes of meetings),^[121] Spain (where a
   lockdown was announced on 14 March),^[122] Czech Republic, Norway,
   Denmark, Iceland, Poland, Turkey, and France, while the United Kingdom
   noticeably lagged behind in adopting such measures.^[123]

   As of 18 March 2020, more than 250 million people were in lockdown
   across Europe.^[124]

Rest of the world

--

   In the immediate context of the start of the pandemic in Wuhan,
   countries neighbouring or close to China adopted a cautious approach.
   For example, Sri Lanka, Macau, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Japan, and South
   Korea had all imposed some degree of lockdown by 19 February.^[125] As
   countries across the world reported escalating case numbers and deaths,
   more and more countries began to announce travel restrictions and
   lockdowns.^[125] Africa and Latin America were relatively delayed in
   the spread of the virus, but even on these continents, countries began
   to impose travel bans and lockdowns. Brazil and Mexico began lockdowns
   in late February and much of the rest of Latin America followed suit in
   early March.^[125] Much of Africa was on lockdown by the start of
   April.^[125] Kenya, for example, blocked certain international flights
   and subsequently placed a ban on 'global' meetings.^[126]

   As of 1 April 2020^[update], more than 280 million people, or about 86%
   of the population, were under some form of lockdown in the United
   States,^[127] 59 million people were in lockdown in South Africa,^[128]
   and 1.3 billion people were in lockdown in India.^[129]^[130]

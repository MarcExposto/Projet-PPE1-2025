   Emergency protocol that prevents people from leaving or entering a
   location
   This article is about the emergency measure. For the mass quarantine
   measure in a disease outbreak, see Stay-at-home order and COVID-19
   lockdowns. For the practice of isolating prisoners, see Solitary
   confinement. For other uses, see Lockdown (disambiguation).

   A lockdown (/ËlÉkËdaÊn/ ^â) is a restriction policy for people,
   community or a country to stay where they are, usually due to specific
   risks that could possibly harm the people if they move and interact
   freely.

   The term is used for a prison protocol that usually prevents people,
   information or objects from leaving an area. The protocol can usually
   only be initiated by someone in a position of authority.^[1]

   A lockdown can also be used to protect people inside a facility or, for
   example, a computing system, from a threat or other external event. In
   buildings doors leading outside are usually locked so that no person
   may enter or exit.

Types

   [edit]

   Lockdowns may be adopted as a preventative measure or in response to a
   crisis as an emergency measure.

Preventive lockdown

   [edit]

   See also: Preventive action

   A preventive lockdown is a preemptive action plan implemented to
   address an unusual scenario or a weakness in system to preempt any
   danger to ensure the safety and security of people, organisation and
   system. The focus for preventive actions is to avoid dangers and risks
   arising from the nonconformity to the normal circumstances, but also
   commonly includes improvements in efficiency.

   Preventive lockdowns are preemptive lockdowns to mitigate risk. Most
   organisations plan for the emergency lockdowns but fail to plan for
   other situations that might quickly degrade to dangerous levels. These
   protocols must be based on the type of threat, and should be kept
   simple and short for quick learning and implementation, and flexible
   enough to handle several scenarios. This allows administrators more
   options to choose from which are easier to use in various scenarios.
   For example, in case of a loud scene by a parent or an unarmed petty
   thief being chased by the police through the school playground, this
   flexible procedure allows school administrators the flexibility to
   implement a more limited lockdown while teaching in school continues,
   thus eliminating need for complete emergency lockdown, disruption and
   delays in resumption of teaching, etc. The consequences of not having
   procedures to implement such lockdowns is that the situation might
   quickly escalate where there could be loss of human lives.^[2]

Emergency lockdown

   [edit]
   See also: Emergency procedure

   Emergency lockdowns are implemented when there is imminent threat to
   the lives or risk of injury to humans, for example, a school's
   emergency lockdown procedures must be kept short and simple to make
   them easier to use under real life crisis conditions. Simple procedures
   can be easily taught with periodic lockdown drills instead of lengthy
   training.^[2]

Purposes

   [edit]

   Both preventative and emergency lockdowns can be adopted for similar
   goals. They may be use for security purposes to reduce the number of
   people on the street to allow police to conduct rescue missions after
   natural disasters. They may be used in public health emergencies, such
   as Ebola and COVID-19, to prevent air-borne diseases from spreading and

   See also: Pandemic prevention Â§ Testing and containment

   Lockdowns can limit movements or activities in a community while
   allowing most organizations to function normally, or limit movements or
   activities such that only organizations supplying basic needs and
   services can function normally.^[4]

2009 swine flu pandemic

   [edit]

   A lockdown was implemented in Mexico from April 30 to May 5, 2009 in
   response to the 2009 swine flu pandemic.^[5]

COVID-19 pandemic

   [edit]
   Main article: COVID-19 lockdowns

   During the COVID-19 pandemic, the term lockdown was used for actions
   related to mass quarantines or stay-at-home orders.^[6] The first
   lockdown during the pandemic was implemented in Wuhan on January 23,
   2020.^[7] By early April 2020, 3.9 billion people worldwide were under
   some form of lockdownâmore than half the world's population.^[8]^[9] By
   late April, around 300 million people were under lockdown in European
   countries, while around 200 million people were under lockdown in Latin
   America.^[10] Nearly 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the
   population, were under some form of lockdown in the United States,^[11]
   and 1.3 billion people have been under lockdown in India.^[12]

   The lockdown in the Philippines started on 14 March 2020 and is one of
   the longest and strictest lockdowns with varying levels of community
   quarantine being imposed on all major islands and cities.^[13]^[14]
   Similarly the lockdown in South Africa started on 27 March 2020^[15]
   and progressed through various levels. It is also one of the strictest
   lockdowns in the world with cigarettes and alcohol banned
   throughout.^[16]

Typical scenarios

--
Schools

   [edit]

   Lockdown procedures vary by site and country. Generally, a lockdown
   means that interior and exterior doors are locked, and all students and
   staff must remain in their location from the time the lockdown is
   announced. In some locations, windows are covered, and students stand
   at the back of the classroom or away from windows.

   Since the Columbine shooting in 1999 and the September 11, 2001
   attacks, lockdown procedures in schools have been changing. Some
   schools direct teachers to continue with standard procedures while
   remaining quiet, while some recommend an active approach against
   threats.^[17]

Prisons

   [edit]

   In prisons, the term lockdown can be defined as a course of action to
   control the movement of inmates. Confining all prisoners, except
   workers, to their cells until the end of the day is an example of a
   "lockdown period" in a corrections schedule.^[citation needed] However
   a "full lockdown" is used when all prisoners are locked in their cells
   to prevent prison riots or unrest from spreading or during an
   emergency.^[18]

Lean manufacturing process

   [edit]

   In manufacturing, the term lockdown event refers to a continuous
   improvement initiative in which manufacturing in a specific area
   (typically a cell or specific piece of machinery) is halted in order to
   contain, and determine, what are the issues that are preventing the
   manufacture of goods from meeting quality specifications. During the
   lockdown event a multi-disciplinary team reviews the specific area's
   manufacturing processes, tooling and machine condition, to find the
   root cause(s) of the problem(s). Once changes to the process, or
   machine repairs that may include adjustments or replacement are
   effected, a sample run is initiated and evaluated. If the results of
   the validation are within the required specifications, the area
   lockdown is lifted and production is resumed. Follow-up sampling is
   conducted subsequently to ensure continuity of the lockdown results.

Newsworthy lockdowns

   [edit]
   This article appears to be slanted towards recent events. Please try to
   keep recent events in historical perspective and add more content
   related to non-recent events. (March 2020)

   In the wake of the September 11 attacks (2001), a three-day lockdown of
   American civilian airspace was initiated.

   At the University of British Columbia (UBC) on January 30, 2008, an
   unknown threat was made, and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)
   issued a lockdown order on one of the buildings on campus for six
   hours, cordoning off the area. A campus alert was sent via email to
   everyone affiliated with UBC, while those in the building remained
   locked in it.^[21]^[22]^[23]

   On April 10, 2008, two Canadian secondary schools were locked down due
   to suspected firearm threats. George S. Henry Academy was locked down
   in Toronto, Ontario at approximately 2:00 p.m.^[24] The ETF were
   contacted and the lockdown lasted for more than two hours. New
   Westminster Secondary School was locked down in New Westminster,
   British Columbia at approximately 1:40 p.m.^[25] The Emergency Response
   Team (ERT) was called, and the school was under lockdown until
   4:30 p.m. Due to the size of the school some students were not able to
   leave until 7:00 p.m.

   On April 19, 2013, the entire city of Boston, US was locked down and
--
   security services sought suspects involved with the November 2015 Paris
   attacks. Later in 2015, a terror threat caused the 2015 Los Angeles
   Unified School District closure.

   In August 2019, the Indian government imposed a lockdown on Jammu and
   Kashmir after the revocation of the special status of the state,^[29]
   by communications and media blackout, claiming that the lockdown was to
   curb terrorism.^[30]

   According to Merriam-Webster, the first known use of lockdown occurred
   in 1973, referring to the confinement of prisoners.^[31]

   Tracking usage changes through events reported up to 1999 in The New
   York Times:^[32]

          Feb 12, 1974, Violent Inmates Are Isolated at San Quentin
          contains the first reference to lockdown.

          Jul 29, 1998, Children in Tow, Tourists Stream to Capitol to
          Mourn Its Guardians, By Lizette Alvarez: "Friday's act by a
          gunman prompted few calls for a lockdown of the Capitol."

          Oct 25, 1998, Report Card in Yonkers On New Schools Chief, By
          Elsa Brenner: "Dr. Hornsby declared a lockdown in the city's
          high schools, informing 6,000 students that they could no longer
          ventue off campus for pizzas and Chinese food."

          Nov 8, 1998, No More Rotten Odors, Sewage Protesters Say, By
          David Koeppel: "At Seaford Harbor School, Principal Barbara
          Bauer, who attended the rally, acknowledged that the smells had
          resulted in one 'lockdown' in the past year. On Oct. 26, parents
          say, a lockdown was declared at another school, Mandalay
          elementary."

          Feb 10, 1999, As Senate Goes Into Lockdown, Quiet Fills Capitol,
          By Frances X. Clines: "the Senate went into lockdown with
          President Clinton's fate in its hands."

          Jun 6, 1999, In Brief: School Hot Line: "there has also been 'a
          massive security lockdown' at all Yonkers schools. ...All but
          one entrance door in each school is locked, and safety officers
          are stationed at each. Everyone entering school buildings is
          being scanned for weapons."

--
          High School in Littleton, Colo., have led school officials in
          the New York City metropolitan area to reassess security and in
          some cases to make changes to minimize threats. At one extreme
          is West Hartford, Conn., where administrators devised what they
          termed a 'lockdown' drill in which students and teachers,
          practicing in case there should be a shooting, lock all doors
          and stay put until they are told that the police have arrived."

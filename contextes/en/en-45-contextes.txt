HIGHLIGHTS

     * Spatial mean AOD, NO[2], and CO over South Asia are higher during
       the lockdown than pre-lockdown period.
     * Country-wise AOD decline observed for India, Pakistan, Bangladesh
       and increase over Myanmar and Nepal.
     * Forest fires in the eastern part of South Asia are a dominant
       source of air pollutants.
     * In-situ PM[2.5 ]data indicates ~20-60% reduction during the
       lockdown.
     * Household sector mitigation can lead to cost-effective and
       efficient air pollution reduction.

     __________________________________________________________________

   South Asia is a hotspot of air pollution with limited resilience and
   hence, understanding the mitigation potential of different sources is
   critically important. In this context the country lockdown initiated to
   combat the COVID-19 pandemic (during March and April 2020 that is the
   pre-monsoon season) provides an unique opportunity for studying the
   relative impacts of different emission sources in the region. Here, we
   analyze changes in levels of air quality species across the region
   during selected lockdown periods using satellite and in-situ datasets.
   This analysis compares air quality levels during the lockdown against
   pre-lockdown conditions as well as against regional long-term mean.
   Satellite derived AOD, NO[2], and CO data indicates an increase of
   9.5%, 2%, and 2.6%, respectively, during the 2020 lockdown period
   compared to pre-lockdown over the South Asia domain. However,
   individual country statistics, urban site data, and industrial grid
   analysis within the region indicate a more varied picture. Cities with
   high traffic loads reported a reduction of 12-39% in columnar NO[2]
   during lockdown, in-situ PM[2.5] measurements indicate a 23-56% percent
   reduction over the country capitals and columnar SO[2] has an
   approximate reduction of 50% over industrial areas. In contrast,
   pollutant emissions from natural sources e.g., from biomass burning
   were observed to be adversely affecting the air quality in this period
   potentially masking expected lockdown related air quality improvements.
   This study demonstrates the need for a more nuanced and situation
   specific understanding of sources of air pollutants (anthropogenic and
   natural) and for these sources to be better understood from the local
   to the regional scale. Without this deeper understanding, mitigation

   2020). The rapidity of its transmission globally and severity of its
   impacts lead to a global public health emergency (Lai et al., 2020;
   Phua et al., 2020). Mortality and morbidity rates rapidly rose and
   public health concerns lead to the conditions of "lockdowns" where
   movement of people and economic activity was highly restricted to
   reduce the spread of the disease. Lockdown related restrictions on
   industry and transport affected global and regional economies (ICIMOD,
   2020; World Bank, 2020). Another result of these lockdowns were reports
   of reductions in air, water, and noise pollution levels, reduced waste
   generation and increased atmospheric visibility (McNeill, 2020;
   Zambrano-Monserrate et al., 2020).

   needed to better understand the impacts on AQ of COVID-19 restrictions
   and changes. South Asia (SA) is a global air pollution hotspot, that
   contains approximately 25% of the global population (United Nations,
   2019) and a wide range of areas with sensitive biodiversity and fragile
   ecosystem (Wester et al., 2019). Regional lockdowns and restrictions
   have provided an unprecedented opportunity to study AQ due to the
   enforced reduction in human movement and industrial activity in the SA
   region. This is particularly important in SA as the region is impacted
   by a wide variety of emission sources both anthropogenic and natural.

   opportunity to understand sector-specific contribution of different
   emission sources to AQ in the region at a range of scales from region
   to country to city. The economic impact of restricted activity did not
   affect all sectors equally with intensive sectors such as transport
   being affected more than residential sector. The lockdown resulted in a
   reduction of 10-31% in GDP, the equivalent of approximately 307-921
   billion dollars (Kanitkar, 2020) primarily associated with restrictions
   on the transport, industry, and power sectors. Thus, providing an
   opportunity to understand the potential of implementing mitigation
   measures in these sectors and its associated costs. In this manuscript,
   we examine the heterogeneous impacts of lockdown on AQ drivers over SA
   using satellite and in-situ datasets to better understand future
   scenarios for mitigation of poor AQ. This study also highlights the
   need for a sector and or activity based understanding of AQ to enable
   effective and efficient implementation of mitigation strategies,

   based on megacity and city scale data as well as selected areas of
   major industrial activity. The analysis period was
   01^st March-30^th April 2020, which includes approximately 3 weeks of
   data prior to the implementation of COVID-19 restrictions and 5 weeks
   of continuous data under more complete national lockdowns. Exact dates
   for lockdown implementation varied from country to country (see Table
   1) with most SA countries having implemented restrictions approximately
   from the third week of March.

   Table 1. List of lockdown implementation timeline in different
   countries.

   To maintain consistency the period 1^st-20^th March was selected as the
   pre-lockdown period, with the 25^th March to 30^th April period was
   designated as the lockdown period. Selected satellite data for 2020 in
   general and the study period in particular were compared with available
   data from 2000-2019. To reduce the influence of missing values in daily
   satellite measurements (e.g., as a result of cloud cover, data quality
   thresholds and limitations in swath areas) available data was converted

   relative share of emissions from forest fires and open biomass burning
   dominates other sources (Jena et al., 2015). As Myanmar experiences
   widespread forest fires during the pre-monsoon season this is expected
   to play an important role in affecting the regional pollutant levels
   during the lockdown period. A study in the pre-monsoon season
   (undertaken between 18^th March 2006 to 11^th May 2006) reported that
   BC emission from biomass burning in SA were higher than those from
   anthropogenic sources (327 Gg and 203 Gg respectively). For this period
   Myanmar accounted for ~80% of all fire activity (Kumar et al., 2015).

   PM[2.5] and CO (Shrestha, 2018). The transport and energy sectors are a
   small proportion of PM[2.5] and CO emissions (combined 12% and 10%
   respectively, Table 2). It is important to note here that residential
   emissions, a major source of PM[2.5] and CO, were not restricted
   through lockdown guidelines so is not expected to change significantly.
   The effects of pre lockdown migration or people movement associated
   with COVID-19 was not considered in detail in this study.

   The transport sector, industrial emission, and the energy sector are
   major sources for NO[x] emission over SA with 35%, 31%, and 15% share
   of total emissions respectively in March and April, compared with 44%
   and 52% for Europe and USA and 29% (Crippa et al., 2018). Lockdown
   enforced restrictions included industrial and transport activities,
   however, relaxation of regulation was also provided for the supply and
   production of essential and emergency services, so emissions from this
   sector are also not expected to be zero. This large-scale decrease in

   (Agrawa et al., 2020). In response to the reduction in power demand,
   renewable energy was given priority over coal-based power plants in
   part due to their marginal cost of production (statement by, Tim
   Buckley, IEEFA's Energy Finance studies) which is expected to reduce
   emissions from the energy sector during the lockdown. A significant
   reduction in re-suspended dust and construction dust was also expected
   due to restrictions on vehicular traffic and construction activities.
   However, on-road re-suspended dust, construction dust, and industrial
   dust are major contributors in cities and industrial zones and are not
   included in the emission inventories (Guttikunda et al., 2019;
   Philip et al., 2017). From the emission data it could be broadly
   expected that a strict lockdown would bring substantial reductions in
   NO[x] levels whereas mitigation of the residential sector and control
   of forest fires would be required for a significant reduction in
   PM[2.5 ]and CO levels.


3.2 Impact of Lockdown on the Air Quality of South Asia

   From the existing literature it can be seen that across SA, pollutant
   levels tend to be higher in April compared to March. Therefore, this
   study analyses the change in AQ due to lockdown in three ways (a)
   comparison of AQ during lockdown with long-term datasets, (b)
   comparison of AQ during lockdown with the AQ in the pre-lockdown period
   in 2020, (c) The impact of lockdown on annual intraseasonal trends in
   AQ for the entire study period. Long-term data sets used in the
   analysis includes the available data sets for the previous years for
   each pollutant.


3.2.1. Comparison of lockdown period (2020) mean with historical long-term
mean

   Fig. 1 (left panel) shows the long-term mean (years preceding 2019)
   satellite-derived columnar AOD, NO[2], SO[2], and CO over SA for the
   lockdown period (25 March-30 April). An understanding of the spatial
   distribution of the pollutants across SA during this period in previous
   years was deemed necessary to examine the impact of lockdown imposed in
   2020. The mean for the year 2020 (Fig. 1, middle panel) represents the
   mean during the COVID-19 forced lockdown period, and the difference
   between long-term mean and 2020 means displays the changes due to
   lockdown (Fig. 1, right panel).

   Fig. 1. (Left) Long-term mean of AOD (2000-2019), NO2 (2005-2019), SO2
   (2005-2019) and CO (2019) during the 25th March-30th April lockdown
   period over south Asia. (Middle) AOD, NO2, SO2, and CO for 2020 over

   Difference between 2020 AOD, NO2, SO2 and CO compared to their
   long-term mean. Fig. 1. (Left) Long-term mean of AOD (2000-2019),
   NO[2] (2005-2019), SO[2] (2005-2019) and CO (2019) during the
   25^th March-30^th April lockdown period over south Asia. (Middle) AOD,
   NO[2], SO[2,] and CO for 2020 over south Asia during the
   25^th March-30^th April lockdown period. (Right) Difference between
   2020 AOD, NO[2], SO[2] and CO compared to their long-term mean.

   Long-term data shows that AOD was usually high over the IGP and eastern
   part of the SA domain due to its high population density, residential
--
   Bangladesh and the Eastern states of India (Fig. 1). Such high CO
   levels in these regions are attributed to the frequent forest fire
   activity during the pre-monsoon season (Girach and Nair, 2014). Over
   SA, the long-term mean of columnar AOD, NO[2], and CO during the
   lockdown period was 0.41 (0.40-0.42, 95% CI), 3.35 × 10^15 (3.33 ×
   10^15-3.37 × 10^15, 95% CI) molecules cm^-^2, and 0.033 (0.32-0.33, 95%
   CI) mole m^-^2 respectively. While that for the year 2020 was 0.42
   (0.40-0.44, 95% CI), 3.77 × 10^15 (3.69 × 10^15-3.84 × 10^15, 95% CI)
   molecules cm^-^2 and 0.0346 (0.343-0.349, 95% CI) mole
   m^-^2 respectively. However, SO[2] means for this large domain from OMI
   are near zero (Krotkov et al., 2016).

   The spatial mean of AOD, NO[2], and CO over SA during the lockdown
   period show an increase of 2.6%, 12.6%, and 5% respectively in 2020
   compared to the long-term means. Fig. 1 shows marked heterogeneity
   (Table 3, Fig. 1). The decrease in AOD is higher over the IGP, ranging
   from approximately 0.1 to 0.4; this accounts for a 20 to 80% decrease
   in AOD. However, in the same period, an increase of AOD from 0.2 to 0.4
   was observed in the eastern part of the domain; this is approximately a
   20-60% increase over the long-term mean of this period. Similar to our
   findings, a decrease of 46% in AOD over North India and 42% in the
   Eastern IGP during the lockdown period compared to the 3 year mean
   using satellite data sets was reported by Kant et al. (2020). Reduction
   in anthropogenic emissions due to restricted activities is main reason
   for decrease in AOD over IGP, whereas forest fires is responsible for
   increase in AOD over eastern part of the domain. CO levels in the year
--
   over the majority of the region, while in the Eastern part an increase
   of ~20-40% was observed.

   Table 3. Percentage change in AOD, NO2, and CO level over the south
   Asia domain and major countries during the 2020 lockdown period
   compared to their long-term means. The 95% confidence interval for the
   percentage change is given in parenthesis.

   The spatial heterogeneity in patterns of decrease or increase of
   pollutants compared to their long-term mean over the region and at
   country-level were also studied. Changes in AOD, NO[x], and CO during
   the lockdown period compared to their long-term mean over individual SA
   countries was shown to have significant variation (Table 3) with 8%,
   15%, and 24% decreases in AOD over India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan and
   an increase of 15% in Myanmar. An increase in mean AOD over India from
   0.35 to 0.39 was reported for the year 2020 compared to the year 2019
   (Pathakoti et al., 2020). This can be attributed to interannual
   variability so a comparison with long-term mean is expected to provide
   a more robust tool in the analysis of effect of lockdown on AQ. A
   significant reduction in AOD with respect to its long-term mean was
   reported over India (Ranjan et al., 2020) which was similar to our
   finding for India. Similarly, a 4-10% decrease in NO[2] level was
   observed for India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan whereas a slight increase
   of 2% was observed over Myanmar. A 17% reduction in NO[2] over India
   for March 2020 compared to the 10-year mean was reported and attributed
   to COVID-19 driven lockdowns (Metya et al., 2020).


3.2.2 Comparison of pre and during lockdown period in 2020

   Satellite-derived data for AOD, NO[2], SO[2], and CO during lockdown
   was compared with that of the pre-lockdown period (Figs. 2 and 3). On
   the regional scale (over SA) AOD, NO[2], and CO indicate an increase of
   9.5%, 2%, and 2.6%, respectively, during the lockdown period compared
   to the pre-lockdown in 2020 (Table 4). During the lockdown period, the
   AOD level over the IGP region decreased (relative to pre lockdown
   values) while an increase was observed in the Eastern part of the
   domain and Northern mountain regions. A decrease in AOD for IGP,
   north-west and east India, and increase over central India during the
   lockdown period was also observed in another study that used both MODIS
   terra and MODIS aqua data (Pandey and Vinoj, 2021). A reduction in
   NO[2] levels was observed over the majority of the SA region but a
   substantial increase was observed in the Eastern area. An increase in
   NO[2] was also observed in the mountainous region along the Northern
--
   mixing and transport of CO coupled with its atmospheric lifetime. For
   SO[2 ]a decrease was reported only over the industrial gridded areas,
   while other regions did not show any clear evidence of change.

   period compared to the pre-lockdown period for the south Asia domain
   and countries (Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, and Myanmar) for year 2020.
   The 95% confidence interval is given in parenthesis.

   Country-specific line plots from running averages of pollutants from
   satellite data are shown in Fig. 3. These clearly show the variation
   reported for the pre and post lockdown phase compared to SA. For
   Myanmar, the AOD and CO data showed sustained growth in levels during
   the lockdown phase that can be attributed to forest fires over this
   region (Fig. 4). A decline in NO[2] levels during lockdown was observed
   to be consistent in majority of the countries attributing to lower
   vehicular emissions. An increase in levels of CO was observed in all
   countries except Pakistan linked to increased forest fire and biomass
   burning activity. It indicates the possible influence of change in
--
   and Myanmar with India and Myanmar on the right Y-axis, and Bangladesh
   and Pakistan on the left Y-axis.


3.2.3. Comparison of the pre and during lockdown trends for 2020 and selected
long-term dataset

   Daily mean of AOD, NO[2] and CO obtained with historical long-term
   datasets over SA shows an increasing trend during the study period
--
   2021). The influence of relative humidity and favorable meteorological
   conditions might also be probable causes of AOD enhancement reported
   over central India (Pandey and Vinoj, 2021). The long-term data in this
   study suggests an increase of 12.5%, 4.9%, and 3.6% in AOD, NO[2], and
   CO, respectively during the lockdown time compared to the pre-lockdown
   time over SA (Table 5). However, in the year 2020, the percentage
   increase in AOD, NO[2], and CO over SA is restricted to 9.5%, 2.0%, and
   2.6% respectively during the lockdown in comparison to the pre-lockdown
   period (Table 4). The lower percent increase of AOD, NO[2], and CO
   during 2020 compared with the long-term data could be attributed to the
   effect of lockdown implemented over the region. In a similar analysis
   for individual countries, Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh AOD values
   declined by 15.6%, 18.3%, and 14.4% respectively during the lockdown
   period in comparison to the pre-lockdown period (Table 4). But the same
   in long-term data increased by 13.6%, 8.2%, and 14.4% for Pakistan,
   India, and Bangladesh respectively (Table 5). On the contrary, AOD
   values for Myanmar indicated an increase of 39.8% during the lockdown
   period in comparison to the pre-lockdown phase, and a 24.3% increase
   was seen with long-term datasets. This can be interpreted as the net
   decrease of 26-30% over India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, 15.4% increase
   over Myanmar, and the net decrease over SA domain by 3%. The decline in
   the NO[2] trend is also observed for SA as well as for Pakistan, India,
--
   and 1% respectively. Whereas for Myanmar it increased by 5% and in
   Pakistan, it remained almost unchanged with a slight decrease of 0.5%.

   Table 5. Percentage change in AOD, NO2, and CO level during previous
   years lockdown period (25th March-30th April) compared to the previous
   years pre-lockdown period (1st March-20th March) with their long-term
   dataset (2000 to 2019 for AOD, 2005 to 2019 for NO2 and 2019 for CO)
   for south Asia and major countries. The 95% confidence interval for the
   percentage change is given in parenthesis.

   The share of different emission sources varies among the individual
   countries, which is one of the major factors in determining the impact
   of lockdown on the AQ (Venter et al., 2020). Cities of China and the
   USA have shown variations in the impact of lockdown and similarly, the
   variation is also reported in China and India (Metya et al., 2020;
   Shakoor et al., 2020). Such variability can be attributed to variation
   in emission share from different sectors of China and the USA and also
   the extent of lockdown. The share of residential emission is large, and
   it is widely distributed over the SA region. Hence, complete mitigation
   of the residential sector emission in South Asian countries can achieve
   considerable improvement in AQ regionally (Lelieveld et al., 2019;
   Upadhyay et al., 2018). Simulations with zero-out emission sectors for
--
   prioritizing emission control for particular sources can expedite the
   air pollution mitigation process.

   A decline in pollutants level for Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh
   depicts the influence of lockdown-driven reduction in anthropogenic
   emission whereas the rise in Myanmar is reflecting the increase in
   forest fire emission during this period. Total fire count over South
   Asia increased from 2150 counts day^-^1 in the pre-lockdown period to
   2359 counts day^-^1 during lockdown with a large-scale forest fire
   event were observed during 25^th March to 06^th April (Fig. 4).
   Residential sector emissions as a major contributor to CO remains
   almost unchanged during this period. So, forest fires as the other
   biggest contributor to CO levels was the most probable reason for such
--

3.4 Local-Scale Air Quality Analysis

   From the above analysis, it was concluded that on a regional basis
   lockdown measures did not bring in a significant improvement in AQ. An
   analysis of various satellite and in-situ PM[2.5] data obtained from
   the US embassy at a city-scale over individual country capitals (Kabul,
   Islamabad, Delhi, Yangon, Thimphu, Kathmandu, and Dhaka) and major
   industrial grid in the SA region was undertaken. The industrial grid
--
   Bihari Vajpayee thermal power station, Jindal thermal power limited,
   Hasdeo thermal power station, Acbil thermal power plant, Hydel power
   plant). AQ for other industrial cities like Karachi in Pakistan,
   Singrauli and Jamshedpur in India, Hetauda in Nepal, and Chattogram in
   Bangladesh were also analyzed (Table 6). Mean AOD for the lockdown
   period was reduced by approximately 20% over Islamabad and New Delhi
   whereas a 15-20% reduction was seen in the selected industrial grid and
   Yangon. An approximate 10% decrease was observed over Dhaka. Cities
   with heavy vehicular loads like Dhaka and New Delhi showed substantial
   percentage reductions of approximately 39% and 21% in NO[2 ]burden.
   Compared to the 5-year mean of NO[2 ]over New Delhi a 54% reduction was
   observed in OMI NO[2] data (Pathakoti et al., 2020) which were similar
   to those observed in the present study. Similar decline in
   NO[2 ]concentration during the lockdown period was shown for many
   cities across the world through satellite and ground-based observation
   (Sharma et al., 2020b; Venter et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). A small
   percentage decrease (ranging between 0.5 to 3%) in CO levels was
   observed over Lahore, Islamabad, New Delhi, and Dhaka during the
   lockdown period compared to the pre-lockdown period. Kathmandu and
   Thimphu showed an increase in mean AOD, NO[2], and CO levels during the
   lockdown period compared to pre-lockdown. An increase in forest fire
   emissions during this period is considered to be the most likely reason
   for this increase. Yangon and Mandalay showed contrasting trends for
   pollutants during the lockdown period. AOD and CO are decreased by 18%
   and 12% in Yangon. A small change (-1.2%) was observed for NO[2] over
   Yangon during the lockdown period compared to the pre-lockdown period.
   In contrast to other SA cities, only a small change in NO[2] level (-4
   to 3% in comparison with 5-year mean) was observed for Yangon
   (Kanniah et al., 2020). A 22% increase in AOD was observed over Kabul,
   which might have been due to increased particulate re suspension
--
   pollutants as would be expected with reductions in industrial activity,
   combustion, heavy vehicle movement and lowering of coal-based power
   generation. This slowdown in industrial activity, limited vehicular
   movement and decreased power needs may have led to the 15% reduction in
   aerosol load and 12% reduction is NO[2] as observed during lockdown. An
   increase of 6% in CO levels over the same period could be the result of
   anecdotal reports of increased open burning. All the study cities
   except Dhaka and the industrial grid showed very low levels of SO[2]. A
   44% reduction in SO[2] was observed over Dhaka. SO[2] levels over the
   industrial grid were approximately 3-4 times greater than Dhaka and
   decreased by more than 50% during the lockdown period. A similar
   reduction of 17% for SO[2] was also reported over the identified power
   plant hot spot domain in east India during March compared to the 5 year
   mean SO[2] (Metya et al., 2020). The industrial cities of Karachi,
   Jamshedpur and Singrauli experienced 8.5%, 25.2% and 41.9% reductions
--
   reductions in SO[2], NO[2] and CO, however Hetauda experienced
   increases in all the selected AQ parameters, which could be associated
   with increased forest fire activity in the region.

   period compared to their respective pre-lockdown period over select
   cities and the industrial grid based on satellite data. The final
   column shows the percentage change in PM2.5 during the lockdown period
   compared to pre-lockdown at the US embassy monitoring stations. The 95%
   confidence interval is given in parenthesis.

   In-situ observations of PM[2.5] from the US embassy monitoring stations
   suggest a substantial decrease at most of the sites except Kathmandu
   (Table 6 and S1). These stations are situated in big cities where the
   transport sector is a major source of air pollution. Comparison of mean
   PM[2.5] pre and during lockdown decreased by more than 50% over Kabul,
   Lahore, and Kolkata whereas over New Delhi and Dhaka a decrease of 35%
   and 39% respectively was observed. A reduction of over 50% in levels of
   particulate matter and considerable reduction in other pollutants were
   also reported from the CPCB, DPCC, and IITM observatories in New Delhi
   (CPCB, 2020; Mahato et al., 2020). The increase in PBL height over
   majority of the study domain during lockdown period compared to
   pre-lockdown might also be one of the reasons for decrease in surface
   PM[2.5] along with decrease in anthropogenic emission (Madineni et al.,
   2021; Zhang et al., 2021). A substantial decrease of 23% and 26% was
   observed in Islamabad and Yangon for PM[2.5]. At one of the two
   stations of Kathmandu almost no change was seen and at the other (Phora

3.5 Mountain Region Analysis

   Over the northern mountainous regions of SA, there was an increase in
   reported AOD during the lockdown period when compared to pre-lockdown.
   In this section, in-situ PM[10] and PM[2.5] data from the Kathmandu and
   Kavre sites were used to further investigate this finding. Comparison
   of PM[10] data for both the sites (Fig. 5) showed much higher values
   (close to three times) at the Kathmandu site (69.7 ± 41.1 µg m^-^3)
   compared to the Kavre site (24.8 ± 10.2 µg m^-^3) in the pre-lockdown
   period. While during lockdown, the PM[10] concentration observed at
   Kathmandu site (37.3 ± 21.3 µg m^-^3) was only 15% higher than that of
   Kavre site (32.3 ± 37.3 µg m^-^3). This indicates that within the
   valley, a high concentration of PM[10] generally exists (attributed to
   sources like re-suspended dust and construction activities) that
   reduced by ~46% during lockdown versus pre-lockdown. Comparison of
   pre-monsoon PM[10] data from earlier study indicates an average of 241
   ± 134 µg m^-^3 over Kathmandu (Putero et al., 2015). These differences
   might exist due to the different pre-monsoon period definitions
   considered by Putero et al. (2015) that ranged from February to May and
--
   PM[10] variation from within the valley with the notable exception of a
   study in 2008 (Aryal et al., 2008) which is not directly comparable due
   to the expansion of Kathmandu between 2008 and 2021.

   Fig. 5. Hourly variation in PM10 and PM2.5 during the pre-lockdown and
   lockdown periods at the Kathmandu (Ratnapark) and Kavre (Dhulikhel)
   sites. Daily variation in precipitation rate (Pcp) is shown by the grey
   line and the right hand Y-axis. Fig. 5. Hourly variation in PM[10] and
   PM[2.5] during the pre-lockdown and lockdown periods at the Kathmandu
   (Ratnapark) and Kavre (Dhulikhel) sites. Daily variation in
   precipitation rate (Pcp) is shown by the grey line and the right hand
   Y-axis.

   Comparison of PM[2.5] at both stations indicates that levels of
   PM[2.5] were ~55% higher at the Kathmandu site (35 ± 14 µg m^-^3)
   compared to the Kavre site (22.5 ± 8.7 µg m^-^3) during pre-lockdown.
   Similar values were also observed during studies from 2006-2007 but
   these comparisons are limited due to the age of these measurements
   (Aryal et al., 2009; Stone et al., 2010). Whereas the values at both
   the stations (33.2 ± 19.8 and 30.5 ± 18.6 µg m^-^3 for Kathmandu and
   Kavre sites respectively) were almost similar during the lockdown
   period. This indicates a stronger influence of sources such as
   transport, small scale industries and combustion within the valley
   region which then decreased during the lockdown period. However, a
   comparison of pre-lockdown and lockdown period PM[2.5] concentrations
   at both the stations indicate a gradual increase in
   PM[2.5] concentrations during the lockdown period reaching a maximum
   between the 5^th-15^th April 2020 followed by a rapid decline. This is
   contrary to findings from other studies on the impacts of lockdown on
   AQ (Collivignarelli et al., 2020; Mahato et al., 2020; Nakada and
   Urban, 2020; Sharma et al., 2020b). The gradual increase in
   PM[2.5] could be strongly attributed to the simultaneous increase in
   forest fires in the nearby regions. This was supported by the time
--
   sites). There is evidence supporting the transport of emissions from
   forest fires up to the glaciers as high as 4000 masl in Nepal
   (Dhungel et al., 2018; Gul et al., 2021).

   Therefore, indicating that forest fire related emissions during this
   season plays an important role for high mountain regions in SA (which
   might have masked the effects of lockdown prompted emission reduction).


4 CONCLUSIONS
     __________________________________________________________________

   This study indicates that spatial means of AOD, columnar NO[2], and CO
   over SA during the defined lockdown period (25 March-30 April 2020)
   were 9.5%, 2.0%, and 2.6% higher than the pre-lockdown period (01
   March-20 March 2020) and with the exception of CO. This change observed
   for the year 2020 is slightly lower than the change observed in the
   previous years pre lockdown and lockdown period, that can be attributed
   to the overall reduction due to lockdown. Country-level analysis
   indicates that during the lockdown a decline in AOD was observed for
   India, Pakistan, Bangladesh (~14-18%) while an increase was observed
   over Myanmar (~40%) and other mountainous regions in the North (i.e.,
   Nepal). While for CO an increase in India, Bangladesh could be
   attributed to the effect of forest fires which dominated over the
   eastern region. NO[2] generally declined except for Pakistan where no
   change was observed. Satellite-based observations over country capitals
   indicate a mixed pattern of change but surface-based in-situ
   observation indicates an improvement in AQ (~20-60% PM[2.5] reduction)
   during the lockdown compared to the pre-lockdown phase. Overall, this
   study indicates that a reduction of vehicular and industrial emissions
   of the level seen during lockdown could lead to a reduction of fine
   particulate levels of approximately ~20-50% at the city level while on
   a regional scale that level of reduction might not be visible due to
   other strong contributing factors. Clearly reflecting the importance of
   other sources of emissions that are not directly linked to the large

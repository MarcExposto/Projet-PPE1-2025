spain
s
death
toll
hit
10
000
after
record
950
new
deaths
recorded
in
last
24
hours
more
than
3

9
billion
people
or
half
of
the
world
s
population
have
now
been
asked
or
ordered
to
stay
at
home
by
their
governments
to
prevent
the
spread
of
the
deadly
covid
19
virus


data
from
an
afp
database
collated
compulsory
or
recommended
confinements
curfews
and
quarantines
in
more
than
90
countries
or
territories


due
to
the
introduction
of
a
curfew
in
thailand
effective
from
friday
the
threshold
of
50%
of
humanity
will
be
reached


meanwhile
the
number
of
dead
in
spain
from
coronavirus
has
now
risen
above
10
000
according
to
the
latest
health
authority
figures
published
on
thursday


it
s
a
new
record
for
the
country
with
950
deaths
in
the
last
24
hours


the
total
number
of
deaths
stands
at
10
003
with
a
total
of
110
238
confirmed
cases
in
europe
s
worst
affected
nation
after
italy


however
the
infection
rate
appeared
to
ease


health
authorities
say
contagion
in
spain
has
dropped
from
a
daily
average
of
20%
until
march
25
to
less
than
12%
after
that
date
more
than
10
days
after
spaniards
were
ordered
to
stay
home


but
the
government
has
acknowledged
that
the
real
number
of
infections
could
be
much
higher
due
to
limited
testing


the
figures
also
show
that
more
people
are
recovering


the
total
now
stands
at
26
743
in
spain
up
from
22
647
the
previous
day


that
number
represents
more
than
20%
of
the
overall
number
of
cases


there
were
reasons
for
optimism
from
italy
too
late
on
thursday
afternoon


the
number
of
new
infections
continues
to
fall
down
to
4668
a
slight
fall
on
wednesday
s
figures
and
a
drop
of
1
500
compared
with
a
week
ago


italy
s
daily
death
toll
was
760
a
slight
increase
against
yesterday
but
down
from
the
more
than
9
000
fatalities
announced
last
friday


unemployment
soars
spain
also
reported
catastrophic
unemployment
figures
on
thursday
evidence
of
the
devastating
effect
the
pandemic
is
having
on
the
economy


jobless
numbers
rose
by
over
300
000
in
march
the
highest
increase
on
record
euronews
spanish
service
reports


the
number
of
people
out
of
work
has
risen
far
more
sharply
than
happened
during
the
financial
crisis
of
2008
spanish
media
say


the
european
union
has
designed
a
new
programme
to
raise
up
to
eur100
billion
to
tackle
surging
unemployment
brought
on
by
the
pandemic


the
aim
of
the
scheme
called
sure
is
to
provide
financial
assistance
to
the
27
member
states
via
loans
from
the
eu


"only
the
strongest
of
responses
will
do
"
european
commission
president
ursula
von
der
leyen
said
in
brussels
on
thursday


in
the
us
new
labor
department
figures
showed
that
more
than
6

6
million
americans
applied
for
unemployment
benefits
last
week
doubling
a
record
high
set
just
a
week
earlier


also
around

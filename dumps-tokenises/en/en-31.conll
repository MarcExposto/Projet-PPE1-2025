residents
confined
to
their
homes
in
a
corner
of
northern
paris
have
been
plunged
back
to
one
of
the
darkest
moments
of
the
cityâs
past


two
streets
â
rue
berthe
and
rue
androuet
â
in
montmartre
in
the
shadow
of
the
sacrÃ©
coeur
basilica
have
been
left
in
a
timewarp
of
the
nazi
occupation
after
they
were
returned
to
1942
for
a
film
set


the
film
makers
were
forced
to
abandon
the
set
when
france
went
into
coronavirus
lockdown
leaving
the
streets
with
fake
facades
for
corset
shops
tailors
a
shoe
repairer
and
mirror
maker
and
dotted
with
war
propaganda
anti
communist
tracts
and
signs
in
german


the
film
adieu
monsieur
haffmann
directed
by
fred
cavayÃ©
is
an
adaptation
of
an
award
winning
play
telling
the
story
of
joseph
haffmann
a
jewish
jeweller
in
paris
at
the
start
of
the
war
who
is
forced
to
hide
in
the
cellar
of
his
shop
as
the
nazis
take
over
the
city

described
as
a
black

the
film
stars
daniel
auteuil
who
despite
dozens
of
international
films
to
his
name
including
1999âs
the
lost
son
is
still
best
remembered
for
his
role
in
the
1980s
films
jean
de
florette
with
gÃ©rard
depardieu
and
manon
des
sources
with
emmanuelle
bÃ©art


the
film
is
due
out
next
year
and
the
set
was
supposed
to
have
been
dismantled
last
weekend


instead
it
provides
an
eerie
reminder
of
a
bygone
era
when
the
streets
were
similarly
deserted
by
many
in
fear
of
the
german
occupiers


a
sign
in
the
window
of
the
fake
pharmacy
âdear
customers
because
of
a
lack
of
deliveries
certain
articles
are
out
of
stockâ
is
an
example
of
life

paris
was
occupied
by
nazi
germany
from
14
june
1940
until
24
august
1944


the
puppet
french
state
under
marshal
philippe
pÃ©tain
relocated
to
vichy
while
gen
charles
de
gaulle
organised
the
free
french
and
resistance
forces
from
london


during
nazi
control
of
the
city
french
police
rounded
up
jews
who
were
sent
to
the
death
camps


meanwhile
the
nightclubs
of
montmartre
remained
open
profiting
from
a
new
clientele
of
german
officers
and
soldiers
while
night
time
brought
black
marketeers
on
to
the
â
streets

from

to

tim
mcinerney
a
university
lecturer
in
british
and
irish
cultural
history
in
paris
and
co
host
of
the
irish
passport
podcast
tweeted
âjust
in
case
quarantined
paris
wasnât
disorientating
enough
my
neighbourhood
was
being
used
as
a
film
set
when
the
lockdown
hit


now
the
whole
block
has
been
left
frozen
in
1941â


he
later
said
âparis
is
of
course
haunted
by
the
legacy
of
the
occupation


thereâs
a
school
down
the
road
that
has
a
plaque
telling
you
how
many
jewish
children
were
deported


âthe
dark
shadows
are
already
there
so
to
recreate
it
is
quite
unsettling
even
more
so
as
a
lot
of
things
written
on
the
posters
are
happening
right
now


one
poster
[from
the
film
set]
said
everyone
must
keep
off
the
streets
between
11

30m
and
4am
which
seemed
a
little
close
to
home
as
just
before
iâd
had
to
show
my
permit
[to
be
outside]
to
the
police


itâs
a
strange
situation

â
he
said
parts
of
the
film
set
had
been
pillaged
and
ripped
down
by
souvenir
hunters

a
lockdown
or
lockup
is
a
designated
period
when
certain
shareholders
such
as
company
insiders
are
prohibited
from
selling
their
stock
often
following
an
initial
public
offering
ipo



what
is
lockdown


a
lockdown
also
known
as
a
lockup
is
a
period
of
time
in
which
holders
of
a
companyâs
stock
are
restricted
from
selling
their
shares


key
takeaways
*
a
lockdown
is
a
period
of
time
in
which
holders
of
a
companyâs
stock
are
restricted
from
selling
their
shares


*
lockdown
periods
typically
last
90
to
180
days
and
while
not
mandatory
they
re
often
requested
by
ipo
underwriters


*
lockdowns
protect
companies
from
excessive
selling
pressure
following
their
ipo


*
the
period
following
the
expiration
of
the
lockdown
can
be
volatile
as
holders
sell
shares
and
new
investors
take
their
place


understanding
lockdown
lockdown
restrictions
are
typically
put
in
place
in
anticipation
of
a
companyâs
initial
public
offering
ipo



they
generally
affect
company
insiders
such
as
founders
executives
and
early
investors


lockdown
periods
are
an
important
part
of
the
ipo
process


company
insiders
are
often
eager
to
sell
their
shares
following
an
ipo
to
cash
out
of
their
investment


however
too
much
selling
might
frighten
new
investors
who
may
interpret
it
as
a
lack
of
faith
in
the
companyâs
future
prospects


lockdown
periods
are
a
compromise
solution
that
requires
insiders
to
wait
typically
for
90
to
180
days
before
selling
their
shares


although
lockdown
periods
are
not
required
by
law
they
are
frequently
requested
by
underwriters
who
want
to
ensure
a
successful
ipo


important
because
underwriters
often
insist
on
a
lockdown
period
investors
should
understand
that
the
lack
of
selling
by
insiders
during
the
lockdown
doesn
t
necessarily
indicate
they
re
confident
in
the
future
of
the
company


they
may
wish
to
sell
but
are
temporarily
prevented
from
doing
so


the
end
of
the
lockdown
can
be
turbulent
for
investors
because
it
s
often
associated
with
increased
trading
volume


insiders
who
are
finally
free
to
sell
their
shares
may
do
so
putting
downward
pressure
on
the
share
price


at
the
same
time
new
investors
who
feel
confident
in
the
prospects
of
the
company
might
take
this
opportunity
to
purchase
shares
at
relatively
low
prices


for
some
investors
such
as
pension
funds
and
other
institutional
buyers
this
increase
in
liquidity
may
make
the
company
more
attractive


lockdown
example
a
notable
example
of
a
lockdown
period
is
that
of
facebook
fb
which
completed
its
ipo
in
may
of
2012
at
a
price
of
$38
per
share


facebookâs
ipo
included
a
180
day
lockdown
period
which
ended
in
november
2012


the
companyâs
shares
declined
to
below
$20
per
share
shortly
after
its
ipo
but
rose
above
its
$38
offer
price
in
the
months
following
the
expiration
of
its
lockdown
period


the
shares
had
gained
nearly
10
fold
by
mid
2021


although
many
insiders
sold
shares
in
facebook
following
the
end
of
the
lockdown
period
new
retail
and
institutional
investors
quickly
took
their
place


in
december
2013
standard
&
poorâs
s&p
announced
that
facebook
would
be
included
in
the
s&p
500
index


this
announcement
further
supported
the
continued
rise
of
its
share
price
by
making
the
shares
accessible
to
exchange
traded
funds
etfs
and
other
investment
vehicles
linked
to
the
s&p
500
index

lockdown
has
forced
people
to
live
for
longer
in
unsuitable
housing

during
the
coronavirus
pandemic
much
of
the
population
have
been
âstaying
home
to
save
livesâ
but
this
has
meant
many
people
have
been
stuck
living
in
poor
housing
conditions
house
according
to
the
latest
housing
report
from
the
resolution
foundation
which
used
understanding
societyâs
covid
19
data
â
age
income
and
ethnicity
affected
the
quality
of
homes
that
people
have
been
occupying
during
lockdown


key
findings
*
younger
age
groups
have
spent
lockdown
in
considerably
poorer
housing
conditions
than
those
in
older
age
brackets


young
people
have
less
space
are
more
likely
to
live
in
a
damp
home
are
more
likely
to
have
no
garden
or
to
live
in
a
derelict
or
congested
neighbourhood
than
older
generations


*
within
age
groups
income
and
ethnicity
are
strongly
corelated
with
housing
quality


the
average
low
income
55
64
year
old
is
more
likely
to
contend
with
damp
or
to
live
in
a
problematic
neighbourhood
than
the
average
25
34
year
old
in
the
highest
income
bracket


and
on
average
those
aged
55
and
older
from
bame
backgrounds
occupy
homes
with
30
percent
less
useable
space
than
their
white
counterparts


*
one
in
five
children
from
a
low
income
household
has
spent
lockdown
in
an
overcrowded
home
while
close
to
10
percent
are
growing
up
in
damp
conditions


nearly
40
percent
of
under
16s
from
bame
groups
have
no
obvious
garden
and
one
quarter
live
in
an
objectively
poor
quality
environment


*
while
housing
quality
has
generally
improved
over
time
overcrowding
has
increased


this
is
an
especially
pronounced
problem
for
those
with
dependent
children


*
the
private
rented
sector
prs
is
the
tenure
with
the
poorest
record
on
damp
8
percent
of
properties
while
the
social
rented
sector
contains
the
largest
proportion
of
households
living
in
overcrowded
conditions
16
percent



the
structural
shift
whereby
many
more
young
people
and
families
with
children
live
in
the
prs
today
than
in
the
past
has
played
a
large
role
in
widening
intergenerational
gaps
in
living
conditions


housing
conditions
have
had
a
stronger
effect
on
well
being
during
the
pandemic


even
after
controlling
for
key
characteristics
such
as
pay
and
relationship
status
the
well
being
gap
between
renters
and
owners
has
widened
over
the
lockdown
period


the
researchers
said
in
the
report
âdecent
living
conditions
are
not
just
a
ânice
to
haveâ
they
have
a
profound
influence
on
outcomes
including
well
being
an
effect
this
note
shows
has
been
amplified
during
the
lockdown
period


moreover
the
inequalities
in
living
conditions
we
document
here
are
far
from
natural


instead
they
are
the
product
of
long
run
housing
trends
such
as
tenure
change
lack
of
building
and
insufficient
regulation
of
privately
rented
homes

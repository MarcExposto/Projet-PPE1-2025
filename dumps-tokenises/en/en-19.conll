learn
how
to
ensure
your
child
s
safety
and
access
to
supplies
and
food
in
case
of
a
lockdown


as
parents
you
know
that
diabetes
management
is
24/7


the
safety
and
health
of
your
child
at
school
depends
on
access
to
care
diabetes
supplies
and
equipment


while
no
one
wants
the
need
for
a
school
emergency
plan
to
ever
be
put
into
action
it
is
important
to
work
with
your
child
s
school
to
develop
a
plan
for
how
your
child
s
diabetes
needs
will
be
managed
in
the
rare
horrific
event
of
a
school
emergency
or
lockdown


practice
emergency
drills
are
becoming
the
norm
in
schools


however
in
the
unlikely
event
of
a
lockdown
situation
where
students
need
to
stay
in
place
in
the
gym
playground
library
classroom
or
other
area
of
the
school
it
is
important
to
take
a
few
steps
to
make
sure
your
child
will
have
access
to
needed
supplies
and
food


schools
must
provide
access
to
care
even
in
the
event
of
an
emergency


while
there
is
no
way
to
perfectly
and
completely
prepare
for
every
situation
proper
and
practical
planning
can
help
to
make
sure
your
child
is
safe
as
possible


do
your
homework


find
out
if
your
child
s
school
or
school
district
has
a
policy
for
lock
down
and
emergency
evacuations
and
what
provisions
have
been
included
for
addressing
the
needs
of
students
with
chronic
illness


knowing
this
policy
will
enable
you
to
better
prepare
for
a
practice
drill
or
a
real
life
emergency
situation


where
are
your
child
s
supplies
kept
so
that
your
child
will
always
have
access


will
your
child
need
to
stay
in
place
or
will
all
the
children
be
sent
to
a
central
location


what
happens
if
your
child
is
enroute
to
the
restroom
the
clinic
or
in
another
area
away
from
diabetes
supplies


identification


it
is
important
that
your
child
wear
medical
jewelry
or
some
other
item
so
that
first
responders
and
emergency
workers
can
identify
your
child
as
having
diabetes


having
visible
identification
will
increase
the
chance
of
your
child
getting
the
care
he
or
she
needs
as
quickly
as
possible


education
and
awareness
for
teachers
and
school
staff


all
school
staff
who
have
responsibility
for
your
child
should
understand
diabetes
including
knowing
signs
of
hypoglycemia
and
how
to
get
help


in
addition
these
school
staff
should
know
where
your
child
s
supplies
and
food
are
kept
and
know
how
to
access
in
the
event
of
an
emergency
or
lockdown


possible
considerations
for
supplies


ideally
your
child
should
always
have
access
to
his
or
meter
insulin
food
water
and
the
restroom


unfortunately
even
the
best
made
plans
may
be
altered
in
the
event
of
a
school
emergency


parents
should
make
sure
a
carbohydrate
containing
food
and
water
is
available
to
the
child
at
all
times


water
is
important
to
prevent
dehydration
that
can
occur
with
hyperglycemia


this
may
mean
that
arrangements
are
made
with
the
school
to
make
sure
food
and
water
are
kept
in
the
classroom
and
other
areas
of
the
school
the
child
may
frequent
to
the
best
of
the
school
s
ability
in
any
given
emergency
situation


if
your
child
is
independent
in
his
or
her
management
a
meter
may
be
kept
with
your
child
at
all
times
or
in
the
teacher
s
desk
or
somewhere
else
in
the
classroom


hypoglycemia
low
blood
sugar



a
quick
acting
carbohydrate
such
as
glucose
tabs
or
a
juice
box
should
be
always
kept
in
the
classroom
or
kept
with
the
student
at
all
times
to
swiftly
treat
hypoglycemia


insulin


children
with
type
1
diabetes
and
some
children
with
type
2
need
access
to
their
insulin


while
the
safest
practice
would
be
to
have
insulin
always
accessible
this
may
be
difficult
in
a
lockdown
situation


if
insulin
is
not
available
the
plan
should
be
to
reduce
food
intake
and
increase
intake
of
water
or
non
carbohydrate
containing
liquids


it
is
important
to
know
the
school
s
plan
for
accessing
medication
in
the
event
of
a
rare
lockdown
or
evacuation


written
plans
and
school
protocols


it
is
important
to
include
a
lockdown/emergency
provision
in
your
child
s
section
504
plan
or
individualized
education
program
iep



work
with
your
child
s
school
or
school
district
to
come
up
with
a
safe
and
practical
plan
that
can
be
incorporated
in
its
lockdown/emergency
evacuations
protocols
and
easily
implemented
in
the
event
it
is
needed

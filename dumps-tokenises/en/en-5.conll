the

worst
economic
downturn
since

the
world
has
changed
dramatically
in
the
three
months
since
our
last
update
of
the
world
economic
outlook
in
january


a
rare
disaster
a
coronavirus
pandemic
has
resulted
in
a
tragically
large
number
of
human
lives
being
lost

as
countries
implement
necessary
quarantines
and
social
distancing
practices
to
contain
the
pandemic
the
world
has
been
put
in
a
great
lockdown


the
magnitude
and
speed
of
collapse
in
activity
that
has
followed
is
unlike
anything
experienced
in
our
lifetimes


april
world
economic
outlook
projects
global
growth
in
2020
to
fall
to
3
percent


this
is
a
crisis
like
no
other
and
there
is
substantial
uncertainty
about
its
impact
on
peopleâs
lives
and
livelihoods


a
lot
depends
on
the
epidemiology
of
the
virus
the
effectiveness
of
containment
measures
and
the
development
of
therapeutics
and
vaccines
all
of
which
are
hard
to
predict


in
addition
many
countries
now
face
multiple
crisesâa
health
crisis
a
financial
crisis
and
a
collapse
in
commodity
prices
which
interact
in
complex
ways


policymakers
are
providing
unprecedented
support
to
households
firms
and
financial
markets
and
while
this
is
crucial
for
a
strong
recovery
there
is
considerable
uncertainty
about
what
the
economic
landscape
will
look
like
when
we
emerge
from
this
lockdown


under
the
assumption
that
the
pandemic
and
required
containment
peaks
in
the
second
quarter
for
most
countries
in
the
world
and
recedes
in
the
second
half
of
this
year
in
the
april
world
economic
outlook
we
project
global
growth
in
2020
to
fall
to
3
percent


this
is
a
downgrade
of
6

3
percentage
points
from
january
2020
a
major
revision
over
a
very
short
period


this
makes
the
great
lockdown
the
worst
recession
since
the
great
depression
and
far
worse
than
the
global
financial
crisis


assuming
the
pandemic
fades
in
the
second
half
of
2020
and
that
policy
actions
taken
around
the
world
are
effective
in
preventing
widespread
firm
bankruptcies
extended
job
losses
and
system
wide
financial
strains
we
project
global
growth
in
2021
to
rebound
to
5

8
percent


this
recovery
in
2021
is
only
partial
as
the
level
of
economic
activity
is
projected
to
remain
below
the
level
we
had
projected
for
2021
before
the
virus
hit


the
cumulative
loss
to
global
gdp
over
2020
and
2021
from
the
pandemic
crisis
could
be
around
9
trillion
dollars
greater
than
the
economies
of
japan
and
germany
combined


this
is
a
truly
global
crisis
as
no
country
is
spared


countries
reliant
on
tourism
travel
hospitality
and
entertainment
for
their
growth
are
experiencing
particularly
large
disruptions


emerging
market
and
developing
economies
face
additional
challenges
with
unprecedented
reversals
in
capital
flows
as
global
risk
appetite
wanes
and
currency
pressures
while
coping
with
weaker
health
systems
and
more
limited
fiscal
space
to
provide
support


moreover
several
economies
entered
this
crisis
in
a
vulnerable
state
with
sluggish
growth
and
high
debt
levels


for
the
first
time
since
the
great
depression
both
advanced
economies
and
emerging
market
and
developing
economies
are
in
recession


for
this
year
growth
in
advanced
economies
is
projected
at
6

1
percent


emerging
market
and
developing
economies
with
normal
growth
levels
well
above
advanced
economies
are
also
projected
to
have
negative
growth
rates
of
1

0
percent
in
2020
and
2

2
percent
if
you
exclude
china


income
per
capita
is
projected
to
shrink
for
over
170
countries


both
advanced
economies
and
emerging
market
and
developing
economies
are
expected
to
partially
recover
in
2021


alternative
adverse
scenarios
what
i
have
described
is
a
baseline
scenario
but
given
the
extreme
uncertainty
around
the
duration
and
intensity
of
the
health
crisis
we
also
explore
alternative
more
adverse
scenarios


the
pandemic
may
not
recede
in
the
second
half
of
this
year
leading
to
longer
durations
of
containment
worsening
financial
conditions
and
further
breakdowns
of
global
supply
chains


in
such
cases
global
gdp
would
fall
even
further
an
additional
3
percent
in
2020
if
the
pandemic
is
more
protracted
this
year
while
if
the
pandemic
continues
into
2021
it
may
fall
next
year
by
an
additional
8
percent
compared
to
our
baseline
scenario


exceptional
policy
actions
flattening
the
spread
of
covid
19
using
lockdowns
allows
health
systems
to
cope
with
the
disease
which
then
permits
a
resumption
of
economic
activity


in
this
sense
there
is
no
trade
off
between
saving
lives
and
saving
livelihoods


countries
should
continue
to
spend
generously
on
their
health
systems
perform
widespread
testing
and
refrain
from
trade
restrictions
on
medical
supplies


a
global
effort
must
ensure
that
when
therapies
and
vaccines
are
developed
both
rich
and
poor
nations
alike
have
immediate
access


while
the
economy
is
shut
down
policymakers
will
need
to
ensure
that
people
are
able
to
meet
their
needs
and
that
businesses
can
pick
up
once
the
acute
phases
of
the
pandemic
pass


the
large
timely
and
targeted
fiscal
monetary
and
financial
policies
already
taken
by
many
policymakersâincluding
credit
guarantees
liquidity
facilities
loan
forbearance
expanded
unemployment
insurance
enhanced
benefits
and
tax
reliefâhave
been
lifelines
to
households
and
businesses


this
support
should
continue
throughout
the
containment
phase
to
minimize
persistent
scars
that
could
emerge
from
subdued
investment
and
job
losses
in
this
severe
downturn


policymakers
must
also
plan
for
the
recovery


as
containment
measures
come
off
policies
should
shift
swiftly
to
supporting
demand
incentivizing
firm
hiring
and
repairing
balance
sheets
in
the
private
and
public
sector
to
aid
the
recovery


fiscal
stimulus
that
is
coordinated
across
countries
with
fiscal
space
will
magnify
the
benefit
for
all
economies


moratoria
on
debt
repayments
and
debt
restructuring
may
need
to
be
continued
during
the
recovery
phase


multilateral
cooperation
is
vital
to
the
health
of
the
global
recovery


to
support
needed
spending
in
developing
countries
bilateral
creditors
and
international
financial
institutions
should
provide
concessional
financing
grants
and
debt
relief


the
activation
and
establishment
of
swap
lines
between
major
central
banks
has
helped
ease
shortages
in
international
liquidity
and
may
need
to
be
expanded
to
more
economies


collaborative
effort
is
needed
to
ensure
that
the
world
does
not
de
globalize
so
the
recovery
is
not
damaged
by
further
losses
to
productivity


at
the
international
monetary
fund
we
are
actively
deploying
our
1
trillion
dollar
lending
capacity
to
support
vulnerable
countries
including
through
rapid
disbursing
emergency
financing
and
debt
service
relief
to
our
poorest
member
countries
and
we
are
calling
on
official
bilateral
creditors
to
do
the
same


there
are
some
hopeful
signs
that
this
health
crisis
will
end


countries
are
succeeding
in
containing
the
virus
using
social
distancing
practices
testing
and
contact
tracing
at
least
for
now
and
treatments
and
vaccines
may
develop
sooner
than
expected


in
the
meantime
we
face
tremendous
uncertainty
around
what
comes
next


commensurate
with
the
scale
and
speed
of
the
crisis
domestic
and
international
policy
responses
need
to
be
large
rapidly
deployed
and
speedily
recalibrated
as
new
data
becomes
available


the
courageous
actions
of
doctors
and
nurses
need
to
be
matched
by
policymakers
all
over
the
world
so
we
can
jointly
overcome
this
crisis

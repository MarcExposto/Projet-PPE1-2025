the
long
awaited
independent
report
into
how
well
or
badly
the
government
handled
the
covid
pandemic
has
been
published


chairwoman
of
the
inquiry
former
judge
baroness
hallett
said
the
uk
s
response
could
be
summarised
as
"too
little
too
late"


the
report
looks
at
whether
lockdowns
were
timely
and
reasonable
and
what
impact
rule
breaking
at
the
heart
of
government
had
on
public
confidence


here
are
some
of
the
main
findings


lockdown
could
have
been
avoided
completely
the
report
says
lockdown
could
have
been
avoided
if
steps
such
as
social
distancing
and
isolating
those
with
symptoms
along
with
members
of
their
household
had
been
introduced
earlier
than
mid
march
2020


but
by
the
time
ministers
took
action
it
was
already
too
late
and
a
lockdown
was
inevitable
it
says


by
the
end
of
january
2020
it
"should
have
been
clear
that
the
virus
posed
a
serious
and
immediate
threat"
while
february
2020
was
"a
lost
month"
and
the
lack
of
urgency
overall
in
government
was
"inexcusable"
the
inquiry
found


voluntary
measures
were
brought
in
on
16
march
2020
followed
by
the
full
stay
at
home
lockdown
seven
days
later


but
lockdown
a
week
earlier
could
have
saved
thousands
of
lives
bringing
in
lockdown
a
week
earlier
on
16
march
would
have
meant
23
000
fewer
deaths
in
england
in
the
first
wave
modelling
suggests


this
would
have
equated
to
48%
fewer
deaths
in
the
first
wave


but
the
report
does
not
suggest
the
overall
death
toll
for
the
pandemic
â
227
000
in
the
uk
by
the
time
it
was
declared
over
in
2023
â
would
have
been
reduced
by
an
earlier
lockdown


that
is
very
difficult
to
tell
as
it
depends
on
a
variety
of
other
factors
that
could
have
reduced
or
increased
the
number
of
deaths
as
the
pandemic
progressed


uk
did
too
little
too
late
leading
to
thousands
more
covid
deaths
says
inquiry
chaotic
uk
government
with
key
figures
criticised
the
report
describes
a
"toxic
and
chaotic"
culture
at
the
heart
of
the
uk
government
during
its
response
to
the
pandemic
which
it
said
affected
the
quality
of
advice
and
decision
making


while
it
says
poor
behaviour
was
displayed
by
a
number
of
senior
leaders
and
advisers
boris
johnson
s
chief
adviser
dominic
cummings
is
described
as
having
been
a
"destabilising
influence"


it
says
his
actions
contributed
"significantly
to
a
culture
of
fear
mutual
suspicion
and
distrust
that
poisoned
the
atmosphere
in
10
downing
street"

arriving
to
give
a
statement
to
the
uk
covid
19
inquiry
in
2023
pa
dominic
cummings
was
johnson
s
chief
adviser
until
he
resigned
in
november
2020
the
then
pm
johnson
is
also
criticised
for
excessive
optimism
in
the
face
of
the
looming
pandemic
and
"oscillation"
on
key
lockdown
decisions


the
report
says
johnson
"should
have
appreciated
sooner
that
this
was
an
emergency
that
required
prime
ministerial
leadership
to
inject
urgency
into
the
response"


instead
he
failed
to
appreciate
the
urgency
of
the
situation
"due
to
his
optimism
it
would
amount
to
nothing"
it
says


meanwhile
his
health
secretary
matt
hancock
is
accused
by
baroness
hallett
of
not
being
"candid"
enough
about
the
uk
s
ability
to
deal
with
the
virus


lockdowns
left
lasting
scars
while
the
lockdowns
of
2020
and
2021
undoubtedly
saved
lives
they
also
"left
lasting
scars
on
society
and
the
economy
brought
ordinary
childhood
to
a
halt
delayed
the
diagnosis
and
treatment
of
other
health
issues
and
exacerbated
societal
inequalities"
it
says


children
were
not
prioritised
enough
with
ministers
failing
to
consider
properly
the
consequences
of
school
closures
the
report
says


it
says
the
vast
majority
of
children
were
not
at
risk
of
serious
direct
harm
from
covid
"but
suffered
greatly
from
the
closure
of
schools
and
requirement
to
stay
at
home"


none
of
the
uk
s
four
nations
were
adequately
prepared
for
the
sudden
and
enormous
task
of
educating
most
children
in
their
homes
the
inquiry
adds

johnson
has
been
criticised
in
the
inquiry
s
report
the
report
says
that
rule
breaking
by
politicians
and
their
advisers
undermined
public
confidence
in
decision
making
and
significantly
increased
the
risk
that
people
wouldn
t
stick
to
the
measures
being
put
in
place


it
lists
events
such
as
cummings
trip
to
durham
and
barnard
castle
in
march
2020
two
visits
to
a
second
home
during
lockdown
by
the
chief
medical
officer
for
scotland
dr
catherine
calderwood
and
visits
to
the
home
of
scientific
adviser
prof
neil
ferguson
by
a
woman
with
whom
he
was
in
relationship
during
lockdown


by
the
time
details
of
parties
and
social
events
in
downing
street
emerged
in
november
2021
there
was
a
"public
outcry"
the
report
says


johnson
and
rishi
sunak
subsequently
received
fixed
penalty
notices
for
their
actions


devolved
governments
relied
too
much
on
uk
all
four
nations
were
criticised
for
their
planning
and
decision
making
which
the
inquiry
says
was
hampered
by
the
lack
of
trust
between
boris
johnson
and
the
first
ministers
the
inquiry
found
that
at
the
start
of
2020
while
all
four
nations
lacked
urgency
in
their
response
the
devolved
administrations
were
overly
reliant
on
the
uk
government
to
lead
the
response


the
four
nations
then
differed
in
their
strategy
for
exiting
the
first
national
lockdown
with
scotland
wales
and
northern
ireland
adopting
a
more
cautious
approach
â
but
this
was
undermined
by
no
restrictions
on
travel
from
england
where
many
restrictions
had
been
eased


the
report
finds
that
in
autumn
2020
holyrood
was
the
only
government
to
learn
lessons
from
the
first
lockdown
and
introduced
tough
locally
targeted
measures
which
helped
avoid
the
need
for
a
nationwide
lockdown


on
the
other
hand
decision
making
in
northern
ireland
was
described
as
"chaotic"
while
the
welsh
government
s
approach
resulted
in
the
highest
age
standardised
mortality
rate
of
the
four
nations
between
august
and
december
2020


scotland

response
inadequate
report
finds
northern
ireland
covid
decision
making
was
chaotic
says
inquiry
how
could
the
uk
have
done
better


the
report
gives
a
long
list
of
recommendations
including
*
to
establish
structures
to
improve
communication
between
the
four
nations
during
an
emergency
*
improve
consideration
of
the
impact
decisions
might
have
on
people
both
by
the
illness
and
the
steps
taken
to
respond
to
it
*
create
expert
groups
to
advise
on
economic
and
social
implications
not
just
the
science
*
ensure
decisions
and
their
implications
are
clearly
communicated
to
the
public
*
enable
greater
parliamentary
scrutiny
of
emergency
powers
the
government
doesn
t
have
to
adopt
the
inquiry
s
recommendations
but
it
must
respond
to
them
which
could
shape
future
policies


the
inquiry
has
already
reported
back
on
britain
s
preparedness
for
the
pandemic
concluding
that
the
uk
failed
citizens
with
flawed
plans


the
private

and
secret

that
tell

of
the

covid

abstract
__________________________________________________________________
south
asia
is
a
hotspot
of
air
pollution
with
limited
resilience
and
hence
understanding
the
mitigation
potential
of
different
sources
is
critically
important


in
this
context
the
country
lockdown
initiated
to
combat
the
covid
19
pandemic
during
march
and
april
2020
that
is
the
pre
monsoon
season
provides
an
unique
opportunity
for
studying
the
relative
impacts
of
different
emission
sources
in
the
region


here
we
analyze
changes
in
levels
of
air
quality
species
across
the
region
during
selected
lockdown
periods
using
satellite
and
in
situ
datasets


this
analysis
compares
air
quality
levels
during
the
lockdown
against
pre
lockdown
conditions
as
well
as
against
regional
long
term
mean


satellite
derived
aod
no[2]
and
co
data
indicates
an
increase
of
9

5%
2%
and
2

6%
respectively
during
the
2020
lockdown
period
compared
to
pre
lockdown
over
the
south
asia
domain


however
individual
country
statistics
urban
site
data
and
industrial
grid
analysis
within
the
region
indicate
a
more
varied
picture


cities
with
high
traffic
loads
reported
a
reduction
of
12
39%
in
columnar
no[2]
during
lockdown
in
situ
pm[2

5]
measurements
indicate
a
23
56%
percent
reduction
over
the
country
capitals
and
columnar
so[2]
has
an
approximate
reduction
of
50%
over
industrial
areas


in
contrast
pollutant
emissions
from
natural
sources
e

g


from
biomass
burning
were
observed
to
be
adversely
affecting
the
air
quality
in
this
period
potentially
masking
expected
lockdown
related
air
quality
improvements


this
study
demonstrates
the
need
for
a
more
nuanced
and
situation
specific
understanding
of
sources
of
air
pollutants
anthropogenic
and
natural
and
for
these
sources
to
be
better
understood
from
the
local
to
the
regional
scale


without
this
deeper
understanding
mitigation
strategies
cannot
be
effectively
targeted
wasting
limited
resources
as
well
as
risking
unintended
consequences
both
for
the
atmosphere
and
how
mitigation
action
is
perceived
by
the
wider
public

due

this
is
taken
to
indicate
that

were
needed
to
better
understand
the
impacts
on

of
covid

a
global
air

2019



regional
lockdowns
and
restrictions
have
provided
an
unprecedented
opportunity
to
study
aq
due
to
the
enforced
reduction
in
human
movement
and
industrial
activity
in
the
sa
region


this
is
particularly
important
in
sa
as
the
region
is
impacted
by
a
wide
variety
of
emission
sources
both
anthropogenic
and
natural


anthropogenic
sources
include
crop
residue
burning
household

emission
from

this
non
homogeneous
restriction
on
air
polluting
sectors
presents
an
opportunity
to
understand
sector
specific
contribution
of
different
emission
sources
to
aq
in
the
region
at
a
range
of
scales
from
region
to
country
to
city


the
economic
impact
of
restricted
activity
did
not
affect
all
sectors
equally
with
intensive
sectors
such
as
transport
being
affected
more
than
residential
sector


the
lockdown
resulted
in
a
reduction
of
10
31%
in
gdp

equivalent
of
approximately
307
921
billion
dollars
kanitkar
2020
primarily
associated
with
restrictions
on
the
transport
industry
and
power
sectors


thus
providing
an
opportunity
to
understand
the
potential
of
implementing
mitigation
measures
in
these
sectors
and
its
associated
costs


in
this
manuscript
we
examine
the
heterogeneous
impacts
of
lockdown
on
aq
drivers
over
sa
using
satellite
and
in

datasets
to
better
understand
future
scenarios
for

of

this

also
highlights
the
need
for
a
sector
and
or

based
understanding
of

to
enable
effective
and

implementation
of

this
is

to
play
an

it
is
important
to
note
here
that
residential
emissions
a
major
source
of
pm[2

and
co
were
not
restricted
through

so
is
not

lockdown
enforced
restrictions
included
industrial
and
transport
activities
however
relaxation
of
regulation
was
also
provided
for
the
supply
and
production
of
essential
and
emergency
services
so
emissions
from
this
sector
are
also
not
expected
to
be
zero


this
large

decrease
in

also
resulted
in

in
response
to
the
reduction
in
power
demand
renewable
energy
was
given
priority
over

in
part
due
to
their
marginal

statement
by

studies
which
is
expected
to
reduce
emissions
from
the
energy
sector
during
the
lockdown


a
significant
reduction
in
re
suspended

and
construction
dust
was
also
expected
due
to
restrictions
on
vehicular
traffic
and
construction
activities


however
on

construction
dust
and
industrial
dust
are
major

and
are
not

from
the
emission
data
it
could
be
broadly
expected
that
a
strict
lockdown
would
bring
substantial
reductions
in
no[x]
levels
whereas
mitigation
of
the
residential
sector
and
control
of

would
be
required
for

high

open

also

a

these

indicate
that
the
expenses

measures

higher

sector
but
the
potential
of

is
higher

hence
mitigation
in

emission
is
comparatively

effective
as
well
as

the

this

the

also
be

at

the

did
not
agree
with
the

but
is
consistent
with
the
decline
in
anthropogenic

high
dust
emission
in
the
pre

might
be
the
reason
for
increased

while
the
rise
in

this
indicates
that
within

a
high

generally
exists
attributed
to
sources
like
re

activities
that
reduced

these

that
ranged

similar

this
indicates
a
stronger
influence
of
sources
such
as
transport
small

industries
and
combustion
within
the
valley
region
which
then
decreased
during
the
lockdown
period


however
a
comparison
of
pre
lockdown
and
lockdown
period
pm[2

concentrations
at
both
the
stations
indicate
a
gradual
increase
in

during
the
lockdown
period
reaching
a
maximum
between
the
5^th

followed
by

this
is
contrary
to

the
gradual
increase
in
pm[2

could
be
strongly
attributed
to
the
simultaneous
increase
in
forest

in
the
nearby

this
was

resulted
in

values
during

events
along
with
increased
pm[2

at

and

there
is
evidence
supporting
the
transport
of

therefore
indicating
that

plays

conclusions
__________________________________________________________________
this
study
indicates
that

means
of

columnar
no[2]
and
co

during
the
defined
lockdown
period
25
march

were

2

0%
and

6%
higher
than
the
pre

period
01
march

march
2020
and
with
the
exception
of
co


this
change
observed
for
the
year
2020
is
slightly
lower
than
the
change
observed
in
the
previous
years
pre
lockdown
and
lockdown
period
that
can
be
attributed
to
the
overall
reduction
due
to
lockdown


country
level
analysis
indicates
that
during
the
lockdown
a
decline
in
aod
was
observed
for
india
pakistan
bangladesh
~14
18%
while
an
increase
was
observed
over
myanmar
~40%
and
other
mountainous
regions
in
the
north
i

e


nepal



while
for
co
an
increase
in
india
bangladesh
could
be
attributed
to
the
effect
of
forest
fires
which
dominated
over
the
eastern
region


no[2]
generally
declined
except
for
pakistan
where
no
change
was
observed


satellite
based
observations
over
country
capitals
indicate
a
mixed
pattern
of
change
but
surface
based
in
situ
observation
indicates
an
improvement
in
aq
~20
60%
pm[2

5]
reduction
during
the
lockdown
compared
to
the
pre
lockdown
phase


overall
this
study
indicates
that
a
reduction
of
vehicular
and
industrial
emissions
of
the
level
seen
during
lockdown
could
lead
to
a
reduction
of
fine
particulate
levels
of
approximately
~20
50%
at
the
city
level
while
on
a
regional
scale
that
level
of
reduction
might
not
be
visible
due
to
other
strong
contributing
factors


clearly
reflecting
the
importance
of
other
sources
of
emissions
that
are
not
directly
linked
to
the
large
scale
economic
activity


this
highlights
the
need
for
a
more
detailed
understanding
of
the
spatiotemporal
distribution
of
sources
in
different
seasons
for
the
effective
design
and
implementation
of
air
quality
mitigation
strategies


this
also
emphasize
for
a
renewed
focus
on
mitigation
activities
at
the
household
level
that
is
potentially
cost
effective
efficient
and
long
term
in
nature


this
study
demonstrates
the
need
for
evidence
based
action
as
opposed
to
anecdotal
evidence
or
assumptions
regarding
solutions
being
the
same
across
the
region
e

g


targeting
transport
only



such
actions
need
to
be
based
on
in
depth
cost
benefit
analysis
considering
the
sectoral
contribution
of
commercial
and
domestic
activity
regionally


this
will
help
to
quantify
benefits
and
define
efficient
and
cost
effective
actions
to
improve
the
quality
of
the
air
that
we
breathe

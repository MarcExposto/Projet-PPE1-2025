during
the
early
stages
of
the
covid
19
pandemic
a
number
of
non
pharmaceutical
interventions
particularly
lockdowns
encompassing
stay
at
home
orders
curfews
quarantines
cordons
sanitaires
and
similar
societal
restrictions
were
implemented
in
numerous
countries
and
territories
around
the
world

^[1]
by
april
2020
about
half
of
the
world
s
population
was
under
some
form
of
lockdown
with
more
than
3

9
billion
people
in
more
than
90
countries
or
territories
having
been
asked
or
ordered
to
stay
at
home
by
their
governments

^[2]
in
addition
to
the
health
effects
of
lockdown
restrictions
^[3]
researchers
had
found
the
lockdowns
may
have
reduced
crime
and
violence
by
armed
non
state
actors
such
as
the
islamic
state
and
other
terrorist
groups

^[4]
in
addition
lockdowns
had
increased
the
uptake
of
telecommuting
reduced
airborne
pollution
and
increased
adoption
of
digital
payment
systems


research
has
also
documented
profound
negative
economic
impacts
in
addition
to
worsened
school
academic
performance^[5]
and
negative
mental
health
consequences

^[6]
lockdowns
were
met
with
major
protests
around
the
world


efficacy
[edit]
several
researchers
from
modeling
and
demonstrated
examples
have
concluded
that
lockdowns
were
somewhat
effective
at
reducing
the
spread
of
and
deaths
caused
by
covid
19

^[7]^[8]^[9]^[10]^[11]^[12]^[13]^[14]^[15]^[non
primary
source
needed]
lockdowns
are
thought
to
be
most
effective
at
containing
or
preventing
covid
19
community
transmission
healthcare
costs
and
deaths
when
implemented
earlier
with
greater
stringency
and
when
not
lifted
too
early

^[16]^[17]^[18]^[19]^[20]
a
study
investigating
the
spread
based
on
studies
of
the
most
common
symptoms
such
as
loss
of
taste
and
smell
in
france
italy
and
the
uk
showed
a
marked
decrease
in
new
symptoms
just
a
few
days
after
the
start
of
confinement
on
the
countries
italy
and
france
with
the
strongest
lockdowns

^[21]
modelling
on
the
united
states
pandemic
suggested
"the
pandemic
would
have
been
almost
completely
suppressed
from
significantly
taking
off
if
the
lockdown
measures
were
implemented
two
weeks
earlier"
and
that
the
second
wave
would
have
been
less
severe
had
the
lockdown
lasted
another
two
weeks

^[16]
the
stringent
lockdown
in
hubei
in
early
2020
proved
effective
at
controlling
the
covid
19
outbreak
in
china

^[14]^[22]
the
relatively
high
number
of
cases
and
deaths
in
sweden
which
kept
much
of
its
society
open
during
the
pandemic
when
compared
to
its
neighbours
with
comparable
demographics
norway
denmark
and
finland
that
did
enforce
lockdowns
is
thought
to
be
at
least
partly
attributable
to
this
difference
in
policy

^[23]^[24]^[25]^[26]^[27]^[28]^[29]
similarly
modelling
on
australian
data
concluded
that
achieving
zero
community
transmission
through
a
strict
lockdown
lowers
healthcare
and
economic
costs
compared
to
less
stringent
measures
that
allow
transmission
to
continue
and
warned
that
early
relaxation
of
restrictions
have
greater
costs

^[18]^[19]
this
"zero
community
transmission"
approach
was
adopted
in
australia
and
a
strict
four
month
lockdown
in
the
state
of
victoria
during
an
outbreak
in
melbourne
combined
with
other
measures
averted
a
wider
outbreak
in
the
country
in
2020

^[30]
new
zealand
and
vietnam
also
adopted
a
"zero
covid"
strategy
throughout
2020
that
included
targeted
lockdowns

^[31]^[32]
a
natural
experiment
study
finds
that
the
partial
lockdown
in
kyrgyzstan
with
curfews
was
just
as
effective
as
the
full
lockdown
in
kazakhstan
with
many
business
closures
at
reducing
the
spread
of
the
virus

^[33]
the
emergence
of
the
highly
transmissible
sars
cov
2
delta
variant
in
2021
led
some
commentators
to
suggest
that
although
lockdowns
continue
to
reduce
the
spread
of
covid
19
they
have
become
less
effective
at
containing
it


lockdowns
in
australia
and
vietnam
in
response
to
delta
outbreaks
proved
less
effective
at
containment
than
previous
lockdowns
were
against
the
spread
of
other
variants

during

19
pandemic
in
peru


one
study
led
by
an
economist
at
the
university
of
chicago
found
that
involuntary
lockdowns
had
little
impact
with
voluntary
distancing
making
up
nearly
90%
of
the
fall
in
consumer
traffic
as
people
feared
the
virus
itself

^[37]
similarly
a
national
bureau
of
economic
research
study
found
stay
at
home
orders
increased
staying
at
home
by
just
5â10%

^[38]
another
study
from
yale
university
found
that
most
social
distancing
was
voluntary
driven
primarily
by
"media
coverage
of
morbidity
and
mortality"

^[39]
on
the
other
hand
some
studies
have
argued^[40]^[41]
that
coercive
measures
probably
decreased
interactions
while
accepting
that
most
of
the
reduction
may
have
been
voluntary


one
of
those
two
studies
by
flaxman
et
al


has
been
criticized
among
other
things
for
having
a
country
specific
adjustment
factor
without
which
the
model
would
predict
a
massive
number
of
deaths
for
sweden

^[42]
one
widely
cited
economic
simulation
asserting
that
shelter
in
place
orders
reduced
total
cases
three
fold
however
held
voluntary
distancing
constant

^[43]
another
study
found
a
30%
difference
among
border
counties
where
stay
at
home
orders
were
imposed

^[44]
another
study
that
compared
the
impact
of
less
restrictive
interventions
on
the
spread
of
covid
19
in
sweden
and
south
korea
with
mandatory
stay
at
home
orders
in
8
other
countries
such
as
france
and
spain
did
not
find
evidence
for
greater
disease
control
in
the
countries
with
more
restrictions

^[45]
however
the
findings
of
the
study
have
been
questioned
due
to
its
numerous
limitations
including
the
small
sample
size
of
countries

^[46]^[47]
some
research
has
also
found
that
an
"advisory"
approach
is
not
adequate
to
control
covid
19
outbreaks


an
analysis
of
an
outbreak
in
northern
italy
found
that
an
effective
reduction
in
community
transmission
occurred
during
a
strict
national
lockdown
and
that
earlier
less
stringent
measures
were
ineffective
at
reducing
mobility
to
a
level
low
enough
to
reduce
the
spread
of
covid
19

^[48]
since
the
beginning
of
the
pandemic
google
has
consistently
collected
data
on
movements
showing
rapid
declines
in
public
activity
long
before
legal
restrictions
were
imposed

^[49]
an
april
2020
poll
found
that
93%
of
americans
voluntarily
chose
to
only
leave
home
when
necessary
regardless
of
legal
restrictions

^[50]
reception
[edit]
a
february
2021
review
of
348
articles
concluded
there
was
acknowledgement
of
the
importance
of
non
pharmaceutical
interventions
in
controlling
the
spread
of
covid
19

^[10]
however
later
research
also
acknowledges
high
societal
costs
though
in
some
circumstances
less
than
the
costs
of
allowing
the
pandemic
to
spread
without
mitigation

^[10]^[8]^[7]
related
to
epidemiology
[edit]
epidemiological
evidence
supports
generalized
non
pharmaceutical
interventions
to
curb
the
spread
of
covid
19

^[10]^[51]^[52]^[53]
during
the
early
stages
of
the
pandemic
in
europe
and
the
united
states
statistical
modeling
which
advised
that
restrictions
were
helpful
to
prevent
a
large
number
of
deaths
were
used
as
the
basis
for
lockdowns

^[54]
this
includes
an
imperial
college
projection
led
by
epidemiologist
neil
ferguson

^[55]
despite
some
criticisms
academics
defended
the
imperial
projection
as
fundamentally
sound
while
admitting
the
code
was
"a
buggy
mess"

^[56]
retrospective
evaluation
of
lockdowns
and
computer
modeling
has
verified
that
they
have
significantly
contributed
to
reducing
mortality
and
morbidity
from
covid
19

^[57]
a
notable
opponent
of
lockdowns
has
included
sweden
s
state
epidemiologist
anders
tegnell
who
has
frequently
criticised
the
strategy

^[58]^[59]
the
swedish
government
s
approach
has
included
minimal
restrictions
and
has
been
controversial
in
part
due
to
the
relatively
high
death
toll
due
to
widespread
transmission

^[60]^[61]
however
the
swedish
government
began
considering
enacting
a
lockdown
in
early
2021

^[62]^[63]
while
arguing
in
august
2020
for
the
need
for
further
lockdowns
in
the
united
states
physicians
ranu
dhillon
and
abraar
karan
argued
for
"smarter
lockdowns"
that
impose
restrictions
on
areas
with
high
levels
of
transmission
and
to
increase
support
to
vulnerable
populations
in
these
locations
to
offset

^[64]
a
number
of
medical
experts
signed
the
great
barrington
declaration
in
october
2020
which
called
for
"focused
protection"
on
high
risk
groups
and
minimal
restrictions
on
the
general
population
to
achieve
herd
immunity
through
covid
19
infection


however
the
majority
of
medical
experts
and
the
who
have
strongly
criticised
this
proposed
strategy
for
its
lack
of
scientific
basis
and
for
being
unethical

^[52]^[65]^[66]
the
declaration
has
also
attracted
controversy
over
its
funding
and
the
authenticity
of
its
signatures

human
rights

related
to
the
covid
19
pandemic
and
gendered
impact
of
the
covid
19
pandemic
the
lockdowns
had
multiple
effects
on
people
s
everyday
lives


some
of
these
were
direct
effects
such
as
cancelling
or
postponing
a
social
event
and
others
had
indirect
effects
such
as
losing
a
sense
of
identity

^[68]
for
example
teachers
often
derive
meaning
and
a
sense
of
life
purpose
from
teaching
but
the
schools
were
closed
which
caused
many
of
them
to
feel
disconnected
from
their
identity
as
teachers

^[68]
many
people
also
felt
that
they
could
not
trust
that
the
things
e

g


doorknobs
and
people
around
them
were
safe

^[68]
people
also
lost
a
sense
of
time
with
the
feelings
of
unpredictability
developing
into
the
opposite
of
the
normal
human
ontological
security

^[68]
instead
of
knowing
what
to
do
what
to
trust
and
what
to
expect
in
the
future
people
felt
disconnected
and
at
a
loss

^[68]
it
also
made
people
more
aware
of
the
pre
existing
problems
they
were
facing
such
as
abuse
addiction
and
racism

^[68]
the
sociologist
ann
swidler
compared
the
social
changes
to
anomie
an
absence
of
social
norms
that
was
first
described
at
the
end
of
the
industrial
revolution
as
the
prior
socially
agreed
upon
system
of
interpersonal
connections
values
interdependence
and
ideas
about
normal
behavior
was
set
aside
and
a
new
system
had
not
yet
emerged

^[68]
some
commentators
have
suggested
that
stay
at
home
orders
are
unconstitutional
or
that
states
use
of
emergency
powers
to
restrict
freedom
of
assembly
and
movement
are
authoritarian
and
may
result
in
long
term
democratic
backsliding

^[69]^[70]
centralization

by
political
leadership
in
hungary
poland

and

to

covid

pandemic
have
been
cited
as
examples

^[71]^[72]^[73]
many
states
restricted
religious
gatherings

^[74]
some
researchers
have
noted
that
covid
19
pandemic
restrictions
have
come
with
mental
health
costs
compounded
by
those
caused
by
the
covid
19
pandemic
itself

^[10]^[75]^[76]^[77]^[78]
systematic
reviews
and
meta
analyses
indicate
that
the
covid
19
lockdowns
were
associated
with
increased
rates
of
depression
anxiety
psychological
distress
and
a
decline
in
health
related
quality
of
life
among
children
and
adolescents
largely
driven
by
school
closures
social
isolation
and
disrupted
routines

^[79]
a
rapid
review
published
in
the
lancet
found
that
quarantine
and
lockdown
measures
were
frequently
associated
with
adverse
psychological
effects


factors
such
as
prolonged
quarantine
restrictions
and
inadequate
information
contributed
to
anxiety
and
post
traumatic
stress
symptoms

^[6]
lockdowns
during
the
covid

pandemic
also
led
to
strained
relationships
increased
cyberbullying
and
physical
consequences

prolonged
covid
19
school
closures
and
the
ineffectiveness
of
remote
learning
especially
in
low
and
middle

countries
exacerbated
educational
inequities
leading
to
substantial
learning
losses
that
could
cost
this

$17

the
covid

disrupted
education
for
1

6
billion
students
at
its
peak
exacerbating
the
gender

with
disproportionately
greater
learning

among
girls
and
increased
risks
of
child
labor
gender

in
some

^[83]
school
closures
during
the
pandemic
resulted
in
significant
learning
loss
although
some
countries
managed
to
limit
the
impact

^[84]^[81]
the
closures
also
led
to
a
significant
reduction
in
child
abuse
reporting
especially
in
florida
where
allegations
of
child
abuse
and
neglect
dropped
by
nearly
one
third


this
decline
has
been
attributed
to
the
limited
access
that
teachers
and
school
staff
had
to
students
who
typically
serve
as
key
reporters
of
child
abuse

^[81]
un
women
warned
in
an
april
2020
report
that
covid
19
pandemic
restrictions
exacerbate
gender
inequalities
and
have
led
to
an
increase
in
domestic
violence

^[85]
many
women
and
men
were
being
forced
to
lockdown
at
home
with
their
abusers
at
the
same
time
that
services
to
support
survivors
are
being
disrupted
or
made
inaccessible

^[86]
for
instance
in
france
there
was
around
a
30%
spike
in
cases
of
violence
against
women
since
the
lockdown
in
march
2020

^[85]
telehealth
had
an
important
role
to
allow
physicians
not
to
miss
the
follow
up
of
patients
with
different
chronic
diseases
and
potentially
helped
to
contain
sars

spreading
among
both
patients
and
healthcare
providers

^[87]
in
late
2023
former
director
of
the
national
institutes
of
health
in
the
united
states
francis
collins
went
viral
online
amongst
critics
of
the
lockdown
response
when
he
discussed
the
lack
of
weight
that
public
health
authorities
had
given
to
the
potential
downsides
of
the
lockdown
measures
when
they
were
formulating
the
official

^[90]
there
was

at

in

economic
circles
that
"severe

â
including
closing
non

and
strict

on

are
likely

some
have

spurred
by

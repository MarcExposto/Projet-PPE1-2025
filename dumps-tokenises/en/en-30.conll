bogdan
levchikov
would
be
your
typical
teenager
anywhere
if
he
didn
t
embody
the
tragedy
of
what
has
happened
to
a
generation
of
young
ukrainians
after
nearly
four
years
of
war


his
father
stanislav
a
career
soldier
was
killed
defending
the
country
s
second
city
kharkiv
just
weeks
after
russia
invaded
in
2022


on
top
of
all
they
have
been
through
his
mother
iryna
50
was
recently
diagnosed
with
stage
three
cancer
of
the
uterus


bogdan
no
longer
knows
anyone
his
age
in
his
battered
hometown
of
balakliya
which
was
occupied
by
the
russian
army
from
march
to
september
2022


it
was
later
retaken
by
ukrainian
forces
but
being
only
70
kilometers
43
miles
from
the
front
is
still
regularly
shelled


"my
mother
and
i
came
back
a
few
days
after
the
city
was
liberated
and
there
were
no
children
left
no
shops
open
nothing
"
he
recalled


only
a
fraction
of
the
pre
war
population
of
26
000
have
trickled
back
and
most
of
them
are
old


the
skate
park
and
the
banks
of
the
balakliyka
river
where
young
people
used
to
hang
out
were
mined
by
the
russians


they
have
been
demined
since
"but
rumour
has
it
it
s
still
not
safe
"
the
15
year
old
said


all
bogdan
s
schooling
is
online
his
days
punctuated
by
air
raid
alerts


the
nine
flights
of
stairs
down
to
the
basement
is
more
than
his
sick
mother
can
manage
so
they
lay
a
mattress
in
the
small
entry
to
their
apartment
the
only
room
without
a
window


"we
ve
gotten
used
to
getting
by
on
our
own


we
re
a
tight
team
"
bogdan
smiled


"it
s
not
just
bogdan


all
the
children
adapted
so
quickly
"
his
mother
said


"this
generation
i
don
t
know
what
to
make
of
them





"
she
is
not
the
only
one
to
wonder
what
the
war
has
done
to
ukraine
s
children


nearly
a
million
young
ukrainians
are
still
living
in
an
eternal
lockdown
doing
either
all
or
part
of
their
lessons
online


first
there
was
the
pandemic
in
march
2020
then
the
invasion
six
years
of
spending
most
of
their
time
in
front
of
the
family
computer
to
study
and
unwind


this
isolation
is
particularly
felt
in
the
kharkiv
region
bordering
russia
which
is
the
target
of
daily
attacks


a
few
bars
and
restaurants
stay
open
until
the
11
pm
curfew
before
night
brings
the
inevitable
russian
drone
and
missile
attacks


mornings
echo
with
the
sound
of
volunteer
teams
repairing
whatever
can
be
salvaged


some
843
educational
establishments
have
been
either
destroyed
or
damaged
in
the
region
a
fifth
of
the
national
toll
according
to
the
ukrainian
government
s
saveschools

in

ua


site


the
online
investigative
site
bellingcat
with
whom
afp
journalists
in
kyiv
and
paris
worked
on
this
special
report
has
logged
more
than
100
video
or
photo
testimonies
on
social
media
of
russian
strikes
on
or
close
to
educational
institutions
or
youth
leisure
facilities
in
and
around
kharkiv


children
in
tears
were
evacuated
when
a
city
centre
daycare
was
hit
on
october
22


"we
re
going
to
find
your
mother
right
away
"
a
rescuer
told
a
little
girl
he
was
carrying
out
of
the
smoke
and
debris
according
to
police
footage


underground
schools
more
and
more
children
are
going
to
underground
schools
in
the
city


yevangelina
tuturiko
has
been
attending
one
since
september
several
meters
below
the
street
with
no
natural
light


"i
really
love
it
"
the
lanky
14
year
old
said
"because
i
can
talk
in
person
with
my
classmates
again

"
ironically
yevangelina
had
to
cross
europe
to
"meet
most
of
my
current
friends"
in
kharkiv
after
being
invited
on
a
"respite
trip"
organised
by
the
city
of
lille
in
northern
france
to
give
ukrainian
kids
a
taste
of
normality


kharkiv
will
have
10
underground
schools
open
by
the
end
of
the
year
the
city
hall
said


priority
is
given
to
classes
where
most
of
the
children
remained
in
kharkiv
during
the
heaviest
of
the
fighting
at
the
start
of
the
invasion
when
russian
forces
pushed
into
the
suburbs
of
the
city


some
70
percent
of
the
city
s
children
were
evacuated
at
one
time
or
another
either
abroad
or
to
the
west
of
ukraine


the
children
spend
only
half
their
school
day
in
the
bunkers
to
make
room
for
others
finishing
their
classes
online


the
school
afp
visited
was
built
to
nuclear
shelter
standards
with
a
heavy
armored
door


"we
are
probably
one
of
the
safest
shelters
in
all
of
ukraine
"
its
principal
natalia
teplova
said
proudly


`children
going
mad
all
outdoor
school
sports
are
banned
in
the
kharkiv
region
for
fear
of
russian
strikes


but
outside
school
it
s
a
little
more
hazy


"official
competitions
are
banned
but
we
re
not
state
run
so
we
make
do
on
our
own
"
said
football
coach
and
former
soldier
oleksandr
andrushchenko
as
he
roared
on
his
young
players


the
handful
of
well
wrapped
up
parents
on
the
sidelines
"understand
that
their
children
haven
t
developed
at
all
athletically
since
the
covid
years


and
that
it
s
better
for
them
to
play
football






than
stay
glued
to
their
phones
"
he
said


inside
kharkiv
s
largest
swimming
pool
complex
educator
ayuna
morozova
agrees
"you
can
t
live
in
constant
fear

"
the
huge
soviet
era
brutalist
building
shut
after
being
hit
in
two
heavy
strikes
in
march
2022
then
reopened
in
may
2024


now
when
windows
are
blown
out
from
the
shock
waves
of
nearby
bombing
they
are
just
boarded
up
with
plywood
or
plastic


"water
and
swimming
cure
everything
"
morozova
firmly
believes


"first
two
years
of
covid
then
four
years
of
war
children
are
going
mad
"
she
said


the
complex
is
now
also
home
to
a
water
therapy
space
for
amputee
soldiers


with
her
flame
red
hair
and
warm
manner
ayuna
lives
up
to
her
tatar
origin
first
name
which
means
"great
bear"


but
like
almost
everyone
afp
met
the
wounds
of
war
surface
quickly


she
was
buried
under
rubble
after
an
airstrike
on
a
public
building
in
2022


"i
still
have
nightmares
"
she
said


"i
avoid
confined
spaces
and
lifts


and
yes
i
did
see
a
psychologist

"
ukraine
lacks
the
resources
to
measure
the
war
s
impact
on
the
young


"we
don
t
have
enough
psychologists
"
admitted
oksana
zbitnieva
head
of
the
government
s
coordination
center
for
mental
health


to
try
to
make
up
for
that
"130
000
frontline
health
professionals
nurses
pediatricians
family
doctors
have
received
world
health
organization
certified
training
in
mental
health
"
she
said


while
"some
countries
have
been
building
their
mental
health
systems
for
50
years
we
were
the
last
to
get
started
because
of
our
soviet
legacy
"
she
added


the
government
has
opened
326
"resilience
centers"
for
children
and
parents
across
the
country
and
"300
more"
should
be
built
next
year
according
to
social
affairs
minister
denys
uliutin


self
harm
when
afp
met
psychologist
maryna
dudnyk
amid
the
sunflower
fields
of
khorosheve
south
of
kharkiv
she
had
just
led
three
hours
of
play
workshops
with
around
50
children
aged
six
to
11
to
help
them
express
their
feelings


as
her
team
packed
away
the
bulletproof
vests
security
protocol
demands
they
bring
them
she
said
"the
war
has
had
a
huge
impact
on
the
emotional
state
of
young
people
we
all
live
under
stress

"
in
her
consulting
room
she
hears
"a
lot
of
fear
and
anxiety
in
children






teenagers
suffer
from
self
harm
from
suicidal
thoughts

"
dudnyk
50
who
works
for
the
ukrainian
ngo
"voices
of
children"
also
carries
her
own
wounds
fleeing
from
her
hometown
mariupol
which
was
occupied
by
the
russian
army
after
a
brutal
siege


"we
no
longer
have
a
home
nothing


everything
was
destroyed

"
some
teenagers
have
grown
a
kind
of
emotional
armour


illia
isayev
hated
it
when
his
family
fled
the
fighting
by
crossing
over
into
russia


the
months
they
spent
there
before
returning
made
him
even
more
of
a
ukrainian
nationalist


the
lean
18
year
old
with
steel
blue
eyes
claims
to
be
a
kharkiv
leader
of
the
ultra
nationalist
group
prava
molod
"the
right
youth"



we
met
him
as
he
trained
a
group
of
young
men
in
handling
military
drones
his
speciality


"hard
times
make
people
stronger


our
era
is
producing
strong
people
who
will
build
a
good
country
"
he
declared


it
s
not
so
simple
for
kostiantyn
kosik
who
is
on
medication
for
his
tics
faintness
and
migraines


"i
m
constantly
nervous
on
edge


it
s
because
of
the
war


it
has
a
huge
effect
on
my
health
"
said
the
bearded
18
year
old
who
was
dressed
in
black


kostiantyn
is
from
the
donetsk
region
which
has
been
ravaged
by
fighting
since
a
russia
backed
separatist
revolt
in
2014


he
grew
up
in
avdiivka
a
martyr
city
now
in
ruins
which
fell
under
russian
control
after
months
of
grinding
battles


"i
have
known
war
since
the
age
of
six


at
first
it
was
very
interesting
for
a
little
boy
the
tanks
soldiers
automatic
weapons


when
i
was
old
enough
to
understand
it
became
much
less
fun
"
he
said


he
spent
weeks
sheltering
in
the
basement
of
his
house
as
it
was
rattled
by
explosions
all
the
neighbours
gone


"in
one
way
it
toughened
me


but
i
would
have
preferred
a
normal
childhood
with
friends
with
joy
"
he
said
his
room
decorated
with
a
large
painting
of
his
hometown


`they
continue
to
dream
like
most
of
the
nearly
four
million
displaced
people
within
ukraine
kostiantyn
s
family
are
just
about
hanging
on


they
rent
a
house
with
no
heating
in
irpin
near
kyiv


kostiantyn
s
mother
spends
her
days
caring
for
his
bedridden
stepfather
who
has
had
a
series
of
heart
attacks
linked
to
the
conflict


kostiantyn
is
proud
to
be
studying
international
law
at
irpin
university
and
despite
his
broken
english
wants
to
be
able
to
work
"protecting
human
rights
in
ukraine
and
elsewhere
in
the
world"


researchers
for
the
who
who
questioned
24
000
young
ukrainians
from
11
to
17
at
the
end
of
2023
found
a
"deterioration
in
the
psychological
wellbeing"
and
"significant"
decrease
in
the
happiness
they
felt


but
there
was
also
a
"fairly
high
level
of
resilience






to
wartime
adversity

"
so
much
so
that
a
unicef
study
in
august
reported
that
exams
were
more
a
source
of
stress
to
them
than
air
raid
sirens
which
"worryingly
suggest
that
war
has
become
part
of
everyday
life
for
many
children

"
"children
have
lost
their
parents
their
friends
and
are
sleeping
in
air
raid
shelters
"
said
social
affairs
minister
uliutin


"and
yet
they
continue
to
live
to
dream

"
when
bogdan
the
teenager
from
balakliya
is
not
drawing
he
plays
and
chats
with
his
"new
friends
"
all
online


he
spends
a
lot
of
time
chatting
with
a
girl
called
lana
with
whom
"he
has
many
things
in
common

"
bogdan
also
has
a
dream


"i
really
want
to
meet
up
with
lana


i
talked
to
my
mother
about
it


maybe
our
parents
can
arrange
something

"
but
lana
lives
in
dnipro
more
than
400
kilometers
248
miles
to
the
southeast
another
world
in
wartime
ukraine


in
the
meantime
balakliya
suffered
another
strike
that
killed
three
people
on

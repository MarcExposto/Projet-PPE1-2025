on
april
8
2020
the
chinese
government
lifted
its
lockdown
of
wuhan


it
had
lasted
76
days
two
and
a
half
months
during
which
no
one
was
allowed
to
leave
this
industrial
city
of
11
million
people
or
even
leave
their
homes


until
the
chinese
government
deployed
this
tactic
a
strict
batten
down
the
hatches
approach
had
never
been
used
before
to
combat
a
pandemic


yes
for
centuries
infected
people
had
been
quarantined
in
their
homes
where
they
would
either
recover
or
die


but
that
was
very
different
from
locking
down
an
entire
city
the
world
health
organization
called
it
"unprecedented
in
public
health
history

"
the
word
the
citizens
of
wuhan
used
to
describe
their
situation
was
fengcheng
"sealed
city

"
but
the
english
language
media
was
soon
using
the
word
lockdown
instead
and
reacting
with
horror


"that
the
chinese
government
can
lock
millions
of
people
into
cities
with
almost
no
advance
notice
should
not
be
considered
anything
other
than
terrifying
"
a
china
human
rights
expert
told
the
guardian


lawrence
o


gostin
a
professor
of
global
health
law
at
georgetown
university
told
the
washington
post
that
"these
kinds
of
lockdowns
are
very
rare
and
never
effective

"
the
chinese
government
however
was
committed
to
this
"zero
covid"
strategy
as
it
was
called


in
mid
march
2020
by
which
time
some
50
million
people
had
been
forced
into
lockdowns
china
recorded
its
first
day
since
january
with
no
domestic
transmissions
which
it
offered
as
proof
that
its
approach
was
working


for
their
part
chinese
citizens
viewed
being
confined
to
their
homes
as
their
patriotic
duty


for
the
next
two
years
harsh
lockdowns
remained
china
s
default
response
whenever
there
was
an
outbreak
anywhere
in
the
country


but
by
march
2022
when
the
government
decided
to
lock
down
much
of
shanghai
after
a
rise
in
cases
in
that
city
there
was
no
more
talk
of
patriotism


people
reacted
with
fury
screaming
from
their
balconies
writing
bitter
denunciations
on
social
media
and
in
some
cases
committing
suicide


when
a
fire
broke
out
in
an
apartment
building
residents
died
because
the
police
had
locked
their
doors
from
the
outside


and
when
the
chinese
government
finally
abandoned
lockdowns
an
implicit
admission
that
they
had
not
been
successful
in
eliminating
the
pandemic
there
was
a
wave
of
covid
19
cases
as
bad
as
anywhere
in
the
world


to
be
fair
this
was
partly
because
china
did
such
a
poor
job
of
vaccinating
its
citizens


one
of
the
great
mysteries
of
the
pandemic
is
why
so
many
countries
followed
china
s
example


in
the
u

s


and
the
u

k


especially
lockdowns
went
from
being
regarded
as
something
that
only
an
authoritarian
government
would
attempt
to
an
example
of
"following
the
science

"
but
there
was
never
any
science
behind
lockdowns
not
a
single
study
had
ever
been
undertaken
to
measure
their
efficacy
in
stopping
a
pandemic


when
you
got
right
down
to
it
lockdowns
were
little
more
than
a
giant
experiment

despite
the
lack
of
scientific
evidence
lockdowns
didn
t
come
out
of
nowhere
at
least
not
in
the
u

s


they
had
been
discussed
and
argued
over
by
scientists
since
2005
when
as
the
story
goes
president
george
w


bush
read
john
m


barry
s
book
the
great
influenza
about
the
1918
pandemic


"this
happens
every
hundred
years
"
bush
is
supposed
to
have
said
after
finishing
the
book


"we
need
a
national
strategy

"
in
fact
there
were
people
thinking
about
pandemic
mitigation
long
before
bush
read
barry
s
book


the
leader
of
this
ad
hoc
group
was
d

a


henderson
perhaps
the
most
renowned
epidemiologist
of
the
20th
century
the
man
who
decades
earlier
had
led
the
team
that
eradicated
smallpox


richard
preston
the
author
of
the
hot
zone
would
later
describe
this
feat
as
"arguably
the
greatest
life
saving
achievement
in
the
history
of
medicine

"
by
the
time
bush
began
pushing
his
administration
to
come
up
with
a
pandemic
plan
henderson
was
78
years
old


ten
years
earlier
he
had
sat
in
on
a
series
of
top
secret
briefings
where
he
listened
to
a
russian
defector
describe
how
he
had
led
a
team
that
was
trying
to
adapt
the
smallpox
virus
for
bioweapons


henderson
became
so
concerned
that
he
started
a
small
center
focused
on
biodefense
which
meant
in
effect
defending
against
a
pandemic


he
and
his
colleagues
at
the
center
had
spent
years
trying
to
persuade
government
officials
to
take
pandemics
seriously
without
much
success


when
the
bush
administration
began
debating
what
its
pandemic
strategy
should
include
it
was
only
natural
that
henderson
be
involved


the
men
bush
chose
to
lead
the
effort
believed
that
lockdowns
could
be
an
important
component
of
a
mitigation
plan


they
were
heavily
influenced
by
a
model
developed
by
laura
glass
a
14
year
old
high
school
student
from
albuquerque
aided
by
her
scientist
father
that
purported
to
show
that
keeping
people
away
from
one
another
was
as
effective
as
a
vaccine


this
story
is
told
overexcitedly
in
michael
lewis
s
book
the
premonition


henderson
vehemently
disagreed


for
one
thing
he
didn
t
trust
computer
models
which
churned
out
estimates
based
on
hypotheticals


just
as
important
they
couldn
t
possibly
anticipate
the
complexity
of
human
behavior


"there
is
simply
too
little
experience
to
predict
how
a
21st
century
population
would
respond
for
example
to
the
closure
of
all
schools
for
periods
of
many
weeks
to
months
or
the
cancellation
of
all
gatherings
of
more
than
1
000
people
"
he
said


in
addition
he
felt
that
the
worst
thing
officials
could
do
was
overreact
which
could
create
a
panic


in
2006
as
the
debate
inside
the
bush
administration
was
nearing
its
conclusion
he
co
authored
a
paper
in
a
final
effort
to
change
the
minds
of
those
devising
the
strategy


the
paper
concluded
"experience
has
shown
that
communities
faced
with
epidemics
or
other
adverse
events
respond
best
and
with
the
least
anxiety
when
the
normal
social
functioning
of
the
community
is
least
disrupted


strong
political
and
public
health
leadership
to
provide
reassurance
and
to
ensure
that
needed
medical
care
services
are
provided
are
critical
elements


if
either
is
seen
as
less
than
optimal
a
manageable
epidemic
could
move
towards
catastrophe

"
the
bush
team
s
final
document
published
by
the
cdc
in
february
2007
stopped
short
of
mandating
lockdowns
but
came
as
close
as
its
authors
dared
calling
for
the
use
of
"social
distancing
measures
to
reduce
contact
between
adults
in
the
community
and
workplace

"
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
effort
a
government
scientist
named
richard
hatchett
would
later
tell
lewis
what
he
really
believed
"one
thing
that
s
inarguably
true
is
that
if
you
got
everyone
and
locked
each
of
them
in
their
own
room
and
didn
t
let
them
talk
to
anyone
you
would
not
have
any
disease

"
which
is
true
as
far
as
it
goes


there
were
other
questions
though
that
were
at
least
as
relevant


could
the
kinds
of
lockdowns
that
are
achievable
in
the
real
world
where
hundreds
of
millions
of
people
can
t
live
in
isolation
chambers
be
an
effective
tool
against
a
pandemic


did
the
virus
truly
go
away
during
a
lockdown
or
simply
hide
waiting
to
reemerge
when
it
ended


and
finally
did
the
many
social
economic
and
medical
downsides
make
them
in
the
aggregate
not
worth
whatever
short
term
benefits
they
might
yield


henderson
who
died
in
2016
never
stopped
making
the
latter
case


"d

a


kept
saying
`look
you
have
to
be
practical
about
this
"
says
his
former
deputy
tara
o
toole


"`and
you
have
to
be
humble
about
what
public
health
can
actually
do
especially
over
sustained
periods


society
is
complicated
and
you
don
t
get
to
control
it


"
as
the
united
states
gains
more
and
more
distance
from
the
covid
pandemic
the
perspective
on
what
worked
and
what
did
not
becomes
not
only
more
clear
but
more
stark


operation
warp
speed
stands
out
as
a
remarkable
policy
success


and
once
the
vaccines
became
available
most
states
did
a
good
job
of
quickly
getting
them
to
the
most
vulnerable
especially
elderly
nursing
home
residents


unfortunately
there
is
no
shortage
of
policy
failures
of
which
to
take
stock


we
do
an
accounting
of
many
of
them
in
our
new
book
the
big
fail


but
one
that
looms
as
large
as
any
and
remains
in
need
of
a
full
reckoning
in
the
public
conversation
is
the
decision
to
embrace
lockdowns


while
it
is
reasonable
to
think
of
that
policy
in
all
its
many
forms
across
different
sectors
of
society
and
the
50
states
as
an
on
the
fly
experiment
doing
so
demands
that
we
come
to
a
conclusion
about
the
results


for
all
kinds
of
reasons
including
the
country
s
deep
political
divisions
the
complexity
of
the
problem
and
covid
s
dire
human
toll
that
has
been
slow
to
happen


but
it
s
time
to
be
clear
about
the
fact
that
lockdowns
for
any
purpose
other
than
keeping
hospitals
from
being
overrun
in
the
short
term
were
a
mistake
that
should
not
be
repeated


while
this
is
not
a
definitive
accounting
of
how
the
damage
from
lockdowns
outweighed
the
benefits
it
is
at
least
an
attempt
to
nudge
that
conversation
forward
as
the
u

s


hopefully
begins
to
recenter
public
health
best
practices
on
something
closer
to
the
vision
put
forward
by
henderson

after
china
came
italy
the
second
country
to
be
hit
hard
by
the
coronavirus


the
italian
government
responded
with
a
lockdown
almost
as
tough
as
china
s


by
the
time
it
was
lifted
in
early
june
34
000
italians
had
died
of
covid
19
up
from
630
when
the
lockdown
was
first
imposed


those
were
frightening
numbers


but
when
neil
ferguson
saw
what
had
transpired
in
italy
he
saw
an
opportunity


for
ferguson
the
head
of
the
infectious
disease
department
at
imperial
college
london
the
italian
government
s
decision
to
follow
china
s
example
meant
that
lockdowns
were
suddenly
a
real
world
policy
option
in
western
democratic
societies
not
just
in
an
authoritarian
country
like
china


as
a
disease
modeler
he
believed
the
same
thing
richard
hatchett
believed
that
if
he
could
lock
everyone
in
a
room
the
virus
would
go
away


but
he
had
long
assumed
attempting
to
do
so
was
politically
impossible


ferguson
is
an
important
epidemiologist
renowned
for
his
estimates
derived
from
computer
models
of
possible
deaths
from
a
newly
emerged
virus


as
soon
as
he
learned
of
the
outbreak
in
wuhan
he
and
several
colleagues
began
modeling
the
coronavirus


on
march
17
ferguson
laid
out
the
team
s
findings
at
a
press
conference


their
model
predicted
that
without
serious
countermeasures
a
staggering
81
percent
of
the
population
in
the
u

s


and
britain
would
become
infected
and
that
510
000
people
in
britain
and
2

2
million
americans
would
die
of
covid
by
late
2020


in
addition
the
authors
wrote
"we
predict
critical
care
bed
capacity
would
be
exceeded
as
early
as
the
second
week
in
april
with
an
eventual
peak
in
icu
or
critical
bed
care
demand
that
is
over
30
times
greater
than
the
maximum
supply
in
both
countries

"
for
ferguson
the
purpose
of
the
report
wasn
t
just
to
release
their
shocking
estimates
it
was
also
to
push
the
american
and
british
governments
to
commit
to
lockdowns
for
the
long
haul


"[t]his
type
of
intensive
intervention
package
"
the
authors
wrote
"will
need
to
be
maintained
until
a
vaccine
becomes
available
potentially
18
months
or
more
given
that
we
predict
that
transmission
will
quickly
rebound
if
interventions
are
relaxed

"
it
worked


in
the
u

k


prime
minister
boris
johnson
had
initially
planned
to
keep
the
country
open


instead
he
ordered
a
lockdown
within
a
week
of
ferguson
s
press
conference


shortly
after
johnson
imposed
the
lockdown
ferguson
was
visited
twice
by
his
mistress


for
obvious
reasons
this
caused
a
furor
when
it
was
discovered


ferguson
was
the
first
though
hardly
the
last
establishment
bigwig
to
ignore
the
covid
19
rules
they
demanded
of
everyone
else


as
for
president
donald
trump
he
never
used
the
word
lockdown
but
he
was
worried
enough
to
call
for
the
country
to
adopt
social
distancing
as
a
mitigation
strategy


schools
restaurants
businesses
they
all
closed


white
collar
employees
who
were
able
to
work
from
home
did
so


more
than
once
trump
mentioned
that
2

2
million
lives
were
at
stake
referring
to
ferguson
s
estimate


trump
s
order
wound
up
lasting
six
weeks


most
governors
issued
their
own
"stay
at
home"
orders
usually
stricter
than
trump
s


even
governor
ron
desantis
in
florida
who
would
soon
become
an
outspoken
opponent
of
mainstream
mitigation
measures
reluctantly
went
along
for
a
brief
period


but
there
were
important
questions
that
no
one
advocating
for
lockdowns
addressed
maybe
because
in
the
urgency
of
the
moment
the
questions
didn
t
occur
to
them


how
long
would
they
last


and
even
if
lockdowns
did
slow
the
virus
s
progression
what
would
happen
when
they
were
lifted


regardless
in
the
space
of
two
months
lockdowns
had
gone
from
being
unthinkable
to
being
an
unquestioned
tool
in
the
pandemic
toolkit

governors
then
explained
the
strategy
to
their
constituents
they
used
the
same
rationale


"if
we
change
our
behaviors
"
said
california
governor
gavin
newsom
in
announcing
his
state
s
lockdown
on
march
19
"we
can
truly
bend
the
curve
to
reduce
the
need
to
surge

"
the
day
after
newsom
then
governor
andrew
cuomo
announced
a
lockdown
plan
for
new
york


he
called
it
his
pause
program
policies
assure
uniform
safety
for
everyone
but
really
it
was
the
same
thing


what
did
flattening
the
curve
mean


here
s
what
it
didn
t
mean
it
did
not
mean
that
if
people
stayed
in
their
homes
covid
19
would
fade
away
even
if
that
idea
was
often
suggested
in
non
expert
contexts



rather
flattening
the
curve
meant
delaying
the
virus
spread
to
prevent
hospitals
from
becoming
overwhelmed
with
covid
patients


during
their
early
press
conferences
many
governors
would
display
a
chart
showing
a
sharp
increase
in
the
estimated
rate
of
covid
19
infections


that
s
what
would
happen
without
lockdowns
they
explained


then
they
would
display
a
second
chart
showing
a
more
gradual
upturn
once
lockdowns
and
other
mitigation
measures
took
effect


simply
put
flattening
the
curve
was
about
helping
hospitals
manage
the
crisis
rather
than
ending
the
crisis


even
those
who
later
criticized
lockdowns
largely
agreed
on
this
point


as
david
nabarro
the
world
health
organization
s
covid
19
envoy
and
an
eventual
lockdown
critic
put
it
"the
only
time
we
believe
a
lockdown
is
justified
is
to
buy
you
time
to
reorganize
regroup
rebalance
your
resources
protect
your
health
workers
who
are
exhausted
but
by
and
large
we
d
rather
not
do
it

"
in
many
blue
states
however
that
rationale
was
forgotten
over
time
and
many
people
remained
confined
to
their
homes
or
apartments
not
just
for
a
few
weeks
but
for
a
year
or
more
even
after
the
vaccine
became
available


and
many
of
the
country
s
biggest
cities
continually
reimposed
lockdowns
whenever
there
was
an
uptick
in
covid
cases
not
just
telling
people
to
shelter
in
place
but
also
closing
small
businesses
and
restaurants
outlawing
sports
events
and
social
gatherings
and
shutting
down
in
school
learning


which
naturally
leads
to
the
obvious
question
did
lockdowns
help
keep
americans
alive


studies
were
mixed
in
their
findings
their
methodology
even
their
definition
of
lockdown


for
instance
in
august
2020
eclinicalmedicine
an
offshoot
of
the
prestigious
british
medical
journal
the
lancet
printed
a
study
that
concluded
that
"full
lockdowns
and
wide
spread
covid
19
testing
were
not
associated
with
reductions
in
the
number
of
critical
cases
or
overall
mortality

"
in
march
2021
christian
bjørnskov
an
economist
at
aarhus
university
in
denmark
compared
weekly
mortality
rates
in
24
european
countries
that
used
mitigation
measures
with
varying
degrees
of
severity


"[t]he
findings
in
this
paper
suggest
that
more
severe
lockdown
policies
have
not
been
associated
with
lower
mortality
"
the
economist
wrote


"in
other
words
"
he
added
"the
lockdowns
have
not
worked
as
intended

"
michael
osterholm
the
prominent
epidemiologist
at
the
university
of
minnesota
also
doesn
t
think
lockdowns
did
any
good


"there
is
actually
no
role
for
lockdowns
"
he
says


"look
at
what
happened
in
china


they
locked
down
for
years
and
when
they
finally
relaxed
that
effort
they
had
a
million
deaths
in
two
weeks

"
as
for
flattening
the
curve
"that
s
not
a
real
lockdown
"
osterholm
says


"you
re
just
reducing
contact
for
a
few
weeks
to
help
the
hospitals

"
dr


anthony
fauci
was
probably
the
best
known
defender
of
lockdowns
as
a
life
saving
measure


but
the
policy
continues
to
have
many
defenders
within
the
public
health
establishment


howard
markel
a
doctor
and
medical
historian
at
the
university
of
michigan
believes
they
succeeded


"the
amount
of
lives
saved
was
just
incredible
"
he
says


markel
pointed
to
an
august
2023
study
by
the
royal
society
of
london
that
concluded
that
"stay
at
home
orders
physical
distancing
and
restrictions
on
gathering
size
were
repeatedly
found
to
be
associated
with
significant
reduction
in
sars
cov
2
transmission
with
more
stringent
measures
having
greater
effects

"
still
the
weight
of
the
evidence
seems
to
be
with
those
who
say
that
lockdowns
did
not
save
many
lives


by
our
count
there
are
at
least
50
studies
that
come
to
the
same
conclusion


after
the
big
fail
went
to
press
the
lancet
published
a
study
comparing
the
covid
infection
rate
and
death
rate
in
the
50
states


it
concluded
that
"sars
cov
2
infections
and
covid
19
deaths
disproportionately
clustered
in
u

s


states
with
lower
mean
years
of
education
higher
poverty
rates
limited
access
to
quality
health
care
and
less
interpersonal
trust
the
trust
that
people
report
having
in
one
another

"
these
sociological
factors
appear
to
have
made
a
bigger
difference
than
lockdowns
which
were
"associated
with
a
statistically
significant
and
meaningfully
large
reduction
in
the
cumulative
infection
rate
but
not
the
cumulative
death
rate"



in
all
of
this
discussion
however
there
is
a
crucial
fact
that
tends
to
be
forgotten
covid
wasn
t
the
only
thing
people
died
from
in
2020
and
2021


cancer
victims
went
undiagnosed
because
doctors
were
spending
all
their
time
on
covid
patients


critical
surgeries
were
put
on
hold


there
was
a
dramatic
rise
in
deaths
due
to
alcohol
and
drug
abuse


according
to
the
cdc
one
in
five
high
school
students
had
suicidal
thoughts
during
the
pandemic


domestic
violence
rose


one
new
york
emergency
room
doctor
recalls
that
after
the
steady
stream
of
covid
patients
during
march
and
april
of
2020
"our
er
was
basically
empty

"
he
added
"nobody
was
coming
in
because
they
were
afraid
of
getting
covid
or
they
believed
we
were
only
handling
covid
patients

"
so
in
attempting
to
gauge
the
value
of
lockdowns
the
most
appropriate
way
is
to
look
not
just
at
covid
deaths
but
at
all
deaths
during
the
pandemic
years


that
s
known
as
the
"excess
deaths"
a
measure
of
how
many
more
people
died
than
in
a
normal
year


one
authoritative
accounting
was
compiled
by
the
spectator
using
data
gathered
by
the
oecd


it
showed
that
during
the
first
two
years
of
the
pandemic
2020
and
2021
the
u

s


had
19
percent
more
deaths
than
it
normally
saw
in
two
years
time


for
the
u

k


there
was
a
10
percent
rise


and
for
sweden
one
of
the
few
countries
that
had
refused
to
lock
down
its
society
it
was
just
4
percent


an
analysis
by
bloomberg
found
broadly
similar
results


in
other
words
for
all
the
criticism
sweden
shouldered
from
the
world
s
public
health
officials
for
refusing
to
institute
lockdowns
it
wound
up
seeing
a
lower
overall
death
rate
during
the
pandemic
than
most
peer
nations
that
shut
down
schools
and
public
gatherings


it
is
not
unreasonable
to
conclude
from
the
available
data
that
the
lockdowns
led
to
more
overall
deaths
in
the
u

s


than
a
policy
that
resembled
sweden
s
would
have

there
were
other
negative
consequences
too


in
the
u

s


lockdowns
forced
hundreds
of
thousands
of
small
business
closures


they
exacerbated
inequality
as
amazon
warehouse
workers
and
meatpackers
showed
up
to
crowded
workplaces
while
the
"zoom
class"
locked
down
at
home


worst
of
all
though
it
had
a
devastating
effect
on
children
whose
schools
were
closed
as
part
of
a
lockdown


during
the
first
weeks
of
the
pandemic
it
probably
made
sense
to
close
schools
given
how
little
was
known
about
the
coronavirus


better
safe
than
sorry


but
by
the
time
school
started
up
again
in
the
fall
of
2020
two
things
were
clear


the
first
was
that
remote
learning
was
a
disaster


the
second
was
that
there
was
surprisingly
little
transmission
among
kids
in
school


well
to
do
parents
moved
their
children
to
private
schools
many
of
which
reopened
their
classrooms


but
most
big
city
public
school
systems
continued
to
rely
on
remote
learning
well
into
the
2020
2021
school
year


it
was
a
tragic
policy
choice


in
propublica
and
the
new
yorker
the
journalist
alec
macgillis
vividly
described
the
consequences
in
baltimore


with
no
classrooms
to
go
to
thousands
of
students
abandoned
school


the
school
system
made
free
laptops
available
but
few
students
took
the
trouble
to
get
one


teachers
gave
up
trying
to
prod
those
who
didn
t
log
onto
their
remote
classes


plus
teachers
had
kids
of
their
own
to
take
care
of
which
made
it
difficult
to
teach


the
anti
lockdown
scientist
jay
bhattacharya
of
stanford
university
recalls
a
photograph
in
the
san
jose
mercury
news
during
the
early
months
of
the
pandemic


it
showed
two
children
7
or
8
years
old
sitting
with
google
chromebooks
outside
a
taco
bell


"they
were
on
the
sidewalk
doing
schoolwork
because
that
was
the
only
place
they
could
get
free
wi
fi
"
bhattacharya
said


"their
parents
weren
t
there
because
they
had
to
go
to
work


i
mean
that
should
have
ended
the
lockdown
right
then
and
there


it
should
have
at
least
ended
school
closures

"
public
schools
have
an
importance
that
goes
beyond
education


it
s
where
many
of
the
rituals
of
childhood
and
young
adulthood
take
place


for
children
who
live
in
unstable
homes
school
offers
some
stability


public
schools
serve
free
breakfast
and
lunch
to
disadvantaged
kids


and
they
re
a
place
where
parents
know
their
children
are
safe
when
they
re
at
work


one
consequence
of
lockdowns
was
that
millions
of
children
had
to
fend
for
themselves
because
their
parents
couldn
t
afford
to
quit
their
jobs
to
take
care
of
them


one
child
psychiatrist
who
works
with
underprivileged
autistic
kids
began
the
pandemic
believing
in
the
importance
of
lockdowns
and
other
mitigation
measures


but
over
time
she
changed
her
mind


"what
really
drove
me
was
my
clinical
experience
"
she
said


"what
happens
to
a
child
when
every
single
support
is
removed
from
them


what
s
the
impact
on
the
family
and
the
siblings


what
i
was
seeing
was
complete
regression


it
was
devastating
and
the
downsides
of
lockdowns
and
school
closings
were
not
being
openly
discussed
in
the
mainstream
media


i
was
horrified


why
aren
t
we
talking
about
this

"
she
described
the
situation
she
saw
as
2022
wore
on
as
a
"sickening
mental
health
crisis

"
the
science
also
weighed
heavily
in
favor
of
opening
schools


by
mid
summer
2020
when
cities
were
trying
to
decide
whether
to
reopen
schools
in
september
146
000
americans
had
died
of
covid
19


fewer
than
20
were
children
between
the
ages
of
5
and
14


more
schoolchildren
died
from
mass
shootings
in
a
typical
year


emily
oster
a
brown
university
economist
conducted
a
survey
of
about
200
000
children
who
were
back
in
classrooms


the
infection
rate
she
discovered
was
0

13
percent
among
students
and
0

24
percent
among
teachers
an
astonishing
low
number


oster
then
set
up
what
she
called
the
national
covid
19
school
response
dashboard
which
eventually
tracked
12
million
kids
in
both
public
and
private
schools
and
continued
to
collect
infection
rate
data
over
the
next
nine
months


not
once
did
the
student
rate
hit
one
percent
during
any
two
week
span


"we
do
not
want
to
be
cavalier
or
put
people
at
risk
"
oster
wrote
in
the
atlantic


"but
by
not
opening
we
are
putting
people
at
risk
too

victor

blue/the

times/redux
over
the
entirety
of
the
pandemic
the
essential
facts
about
schools
never
changed


the
infection
rate
for
teachers
in
sweden
where
most
schools
stayed
open
was
no
higher
than
the
infection
rate
for
teachers
in
finland
which
had
closed
its
schools


in
early
2021
three
cdc
scientists
acknowledged
in
the
journal
of
the
american
medical
association
"as
many
schools
have
reopened
for
in
person
instruction
in
some
parts
of
the
u

s









there
has
been
little
evidence
that
schools
have
contributed
meaningfully
to
increased
community
transmission

"
so
why
did
so
many
big
city
schools
stay
closed
long
after
the
evidence
was
clear


there
were
three
reasons


the
first
and
most
understandable
was
fear


no
matter
how
small
the
chance
no
parent
wanted
his
or
her
child
to
die
from
covid
19


and
no
teacher
wanted
to
become
infected
while
in
school
and
bring
covid
19
home


because
kids
often
brought
colds
and
flus
to
school
which
then
spread
to
others
both
parents
and
teachers
had
a
hard
time
accepting
that
that
was
not
how
the
virus
spread


here
for
instance
was
a
typical
comment
from
a
teacher
in
westchester
reacting
to
a
series
of
new
york
times
articles
about
reopening
schools
tell
me
how
to
get
a
6
year
old
to
not
sneeze
on
his
friends
let
alone
play
and
work
from
a
distance
mucus
saliva
pee
poop
this
is
all
part
of
our
day
at
the
lower
levels
of
education



tell
me
how
each
child
is
going
to
have
her
own
supplies
for
the
day
as
shared
supplies
are
no
longer
an
option


no
more
legos
no
more
books


tell
me
how
to
comfort
a
hysterical
child
from
a
distance
of
six
feet


that
it
was
well
established
that
the
coronavirus
was
not
spread
through
saliva
or
pee
or
by
sharing
books
didn
t
matter


too
many
people
were
simply
unable
to
judge
risk
rationally
a
problem
due
in
part
to
unwillingness
of
government
officials
to
talk
honestly
about
covid
19


in
2020
for
instance
covid
19
ranked
below
suicide
cancer
accidents
homicide
and
even
heart
disease
as
a
cause
of
death
for
children
under
the
age
of
15
according
to
cdc
data


yet
public
health
experts
did
not
stress
any
of
this
on
the
contrary
many
of
them
emphasized
instead
that
children
could
get
covid
19
without
explaining
how
small
the
risk
was


is
it
any
wonder
then
that
covid
19
seemed
to
be
the
only
thing
parents
and
teachers
focused
on


the
second
factor
was
trump


on
july
6
he
tweeted
"schools
must
reopen
in
the
fall



"
the
next
day
at
a
white
house
event
the
president
said
"we
re
very
much
going
to
put
pressure
on
governors
and
everybody
else
to
open
the
schools


it
s
very
important
for
our
country


it
s
very
important
for
the
well
being
of
the
student
and
the
parents

"
in
this
case
trump
happened
to
be
right
it
was
important


but
by
this
late
stage
in
his
presidency
most
democrats
assumed
that
anything
he
said
was
a
lie


if
trump
said
schools
should
reopen
that
was
reason
enough
for
them
to
assume
they
should
stay
closed


the
sense
that
opening
up
was
a
trump
endorsed
policy
seems
to
have
energized
opposition
to
it
in
blue
america
even
as
data
accumulated
that
the
harm
being
done
to
the
country
s
children
outweighed
any
potential
benefit


the
third
reason
was
the
teachers
unions


public
school
teachers
were
unionized
and
their
unions
american
federation
of
teachers
aft
and
the
national
education
association
nea
were
allies
of
and
contributors
to
the
democratic
party
which
dominated
most
major
urban
areas


they
held
enormous
sway
over
big
city
school
systems


no
one
can
doubt
that
teachers
were
afraid
of
dying
of
covid
19


they
truly
believed
they
were
putting
themselves
in
harm
s
way
if
they
went
back
into
a
classroom
full
of
children


but
instead
of
helping
their
members
see
how
small
the
risk
truly
was
the
teachers
unions
embraced
the
fight
to
keep
teachers
away
from
the
classroom


by
the
time
september
2020
rolled
around
at
least
a
dozen
of
america
s
biggest
cities
started
the
school
year
remotely


they
included
los
angeles
san
francisco
new
york
chicago
and
houston
all
cities
with
the
kind
of
large
disadvantaged
communities
that
would
suffer
the
most
if
schools
were
closed


in
most
cases
city
officials
said
they
were
trying
to
move
from
remote
learning
to
at
least
a
hybrid
model
in
which
students
would
spend
several
days
a
week
in
classrooms
and
the
rest
of
the
week
online


in
school
districts
that
did
open
their
schools
that
fall
the
results
were
remarkably
aligned
with
emily
oster
s
data


in
new
york
mayor
bill
de
blasio
was
finally
able
to
get
the
schools
open
in
late
september
between
thanksgiving
and
the
end
of
the
year
the
city
s
positivity
rate
rose
from
3
percent
to
6
percent


the
positivity
rate
in
the
public
schools
also
rose
from
0

28
percent
to
0

67
percent


"the
safest
place
in
new
york
city
is
of
course
our
public
schools
"
said
de
blasio


to
the
holdout
unions
those
numbers
didn
t
matter


ultimately
only
15
percent
of
school
districts
offered
full
time
classroom
instruction
during
the
fall
2020
semester


by
2022
journalists
academics
and
even
some
public
health
officials
were
finally
coming
to
grips
with
the
enormous
damage
done
to
children
especially
disadvantaged
children
because
of
remote
learning


a
lengthy
analysis
by
two
professors
in
the
atlantic
toted
up
some
of
the
issues


first
millions
of
kids
simply
gave
up
on
learning


in
new
york
even
after
schools
had
reopened
the
chronic
absentee
rate
was
40
percent
up
from
26
percent
before
the
pandemic


studies
showed
that
public
school
children
got
less
exercise
no
recess
and
ate
more
junk
food
no
free
hot
meals
during
the
pandemic


according
to
a
cdc
survey
during
the
first
six
months
of
2021
nearly
half
the
high
school
students
surveyed
"felt
persistently
sad
or
helpless

"
parental
emotional
abuse
was
four
times
higher
than
in
2013
and
parental
physical
abuse
nearly
doubled
the
atlantic
reported


a
study
by
three
major
research
institutions
including
harvard
s
center
for
education
policy
research
showed
that
the
longer
a
school
relied
on
remote
learning
the
further
behind
their
students
were


"in
high
poverty
schools
that
were
remote
for
more
than
half
of
2021
the
loss
was
about
half
of
a
school
year
s
worth
of
typical
achievement
growth
"
said
thomas
kane
the
director
of
the
harvard
center


although
test
scores
in
2023
would
suggest
that
students
were
slowly
catching
up
those
scores
didn
t
take
into
account
the
kids
who
had
dropped
out
entirely


one
analysis
found
an
estimated
230
000
students
in
21
states
whose
absences
could
not
be
accounted
for


they
had
simply
gone
missing


"the
pandemic
has
amounted
to
a
comprehensive
assault
on
the
american
public
school
"
concluded
the
authors
of
the
atlantic
article


yet
as
late
as
the
fall
of
2022
there
were
still
those
who
refused
to
acknowledge
the
damage
done
by
lengthy
school
closings


one
such
person
was
anthony
fauci


in
august
2022
fauci
announced
that
he
planned
to
retire
at
the
end
of
the
year


over
the
next
few
months
he
made
the
rounds
to
discuss
how
the
country
had
fared
during
the
pandemic


invariably
he
was
asked
whether
he
regretted
his
forceful
advocacy
of
lockdowns
especially
given
its
effect
on
children


at
one
forum
he
said
"sometimes
when
you
do
draconian
things
it
has
collateral
negative
consequences







on
the
economy
on
the
schoolchildren

"
but
he
added
"the
only
way
to
stop
something
cold
in
its
tracks
is
to
try
and
shut
things
down

"
what
he
could
never
acknowledge
was
that
"shutting
things
down"
didn
t
stop
the
virus
and
that
keeping
schools
closed
didn
t
save
kids
lives


then
again
to
understand
that
you
had
to
be
willing
to
follow
the
science

from
the
big
fail

the

revealed

who
america
protects

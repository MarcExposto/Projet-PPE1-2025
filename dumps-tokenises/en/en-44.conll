lockdown
procedures
distinction
between
"lockdowns"
and
"shelter
in
place"
lockdowns
a
lockdown
occurs
when
occupants
of
the
university
are
directed
to
remain
confined
to
a
room/area
with
specific
procedures
to
follow
regarding
locking
of
doors
closing
of
windows/shades
seeking
cover
etc


this
procedure
is
implemented
when
a
criminal
element
is
believed
to
be
on
the
premises
and
officials
expect
that
these
measures
will
minimize
risk
exposure
of
the
occupants
to
the
criminal
element


lockdowns
necessitate
a
law
enforcement
response
and
immediate
intervention


while
responsibility
for
determining
an
immediate
lockdown
rests
primarily
with
the
university
police
both
the
university
officials
and
law
enforcement
officials
are
strongly
encouraged
to
confer
with
one
another
during
this
process


this
will
help
ensure
safe
and
efficient
handling
of
university
lockdown
events


shelter
in
place
sheltering
in
place
is
similar
to
lockdown
in
that
the
occupants
are
to
remain
on
the
premises
but
may
require
that
they
be
moved
to
a
different
part
of
the
university
due
to
an
environmental
event
taking
place
outside
of
the
university


for
example
the
release
of
a
chemical
cloud
from
a
nearby
incident
power
lines
down
or
a
weather
related
emergency


evacuation
may
put
the
occupants
at
greater
risk
then
sheltering
them
within
the
university


however
it
may
be
prudent
to
move
all
of
the
occupants
to
another
part
of
the
university
to
further
minimize
the
risk
of
exposure


a
âlockdownâ
condition
is
initiated
for
weapons
related
violence
usually
involving
the
presence
of
an
emotionally
disturbed
person
or
persons
who
are
threatening
have
committed
or
are
in
the
process
of
committing
violent
acts


lockdown
is
a
baseline
plan
designed
to
deny
the
attacker
access
to
potential
victims


there
is
no
one
magic
solution
to
cover
all
situations
and
scenarios


members
of
the
campus
community
are
encouraged
to
âthink
on
their
feet

â
lockdown
applies
to
everyone
faculty
staff
students
administrators
and
guests
of
the
university


any
member
of
the
campus
community
who
believes
weapon
related
violence
is
taking
place
should
dial
3111
or
978

665

3111
from
a
cell
phone
immediately


lockdown
announcements
can
be
made
by
fitchburg
state
alert
a
campus
wide
emergency
notification
system
and
by
police
cruiser
public
announcement
pa
systems
hand
held
bullhorns
webs
call
boxes
or
the
official
fitchburg
state
social
media
account


once
a
lockdown
order
is
given
*
immediately
lock
classroom
or
office
door
s



*
shut
lights
off
and
turn
monitors
off


*
help
students
remain
calm
and
caution
them
to
remain
completely
quiet


*
maintain
your
attendance
of
those
you
have
in
your
area


*
ensure
that
everyone
remains
in
a
safe
spot
out
of
view
from
both
exterior
and
interior
windows


*
faculty
staff
and
students
outside
should
pay
attention
to
the
police
pa
system


*
keep
cover
and
concealment
in
mind


*
if
you
are
attacked
directly
scatter


*
lockdown
protocol
supersedes
standard
fire
alarm
evacuation
procedures


ignore
the
fire
alarm
unless
evidence
of
fire
is
apparent
you
see
smoke
or
fire



this
is
a
âthink
on
your
feetâ
moment


police
response
*
lockdown
buys
a
handful
of
minutes
for
police
to
take
action


*
outer
perimeter
of
the
campus
will
be
established
and
secured


*
police
will
arrive
and
form
a
contact
team


*
police
will
make
rapid
entry
to
aggressively
address
the
threatâstay
out
of
the
way


*
police
will
move
directly
to
the
violence
past
injured
people
they
will
be
cared
for
as
soon
as
possible



situation
resolved
*
unlock
or
evacuation
will
begin
when
situation
is
resolved
or
stabilized


*
be
prepared
for
lockdown
to
last
hours


*
unlock
teams
consisting
of
university
police
and
other
law
enforcement
agencies
will
open
your
doors
inspect
occupants
of
the
room
and
give
further
instructions


*
staging
areas
for
medical
triage
will
be
established
for
treating
injured


this
lockdown
plan
remains
fluid
and
may
be
changed
during
an
emergency

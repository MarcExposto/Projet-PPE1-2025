have
been
among
those
most
socially
impacted
by

pandemic
but
also
the
most
prepared

cope
with
the
quick
shift
towards
virtual
environments
that
the
pandemic
triggered


for
many
young
people
in
europe
and
central
asia
covid
19
interrupted
their
schooling
and
left
them
jobless
and
is
still
making
it
more
difficult
to
integrate
into
the
labour
market


with
school
closures
and
uncertainty
about
their
futures
many
feel
isolated
facing
increased
levels
of
stress
anxiety
and
depression


in
the
face
of
this
situation
the
united
nations
childrenâs
fund
unicef
and
the
european
training
foundation
etf

forces
to
look
at
the
challenges
opportunities

their
current
and
future
prospects

the
era
of

others
their
feelings
about
lockdown

learning
outcomes
and
the
quality
of
teaching
as
well
as
their
views
on
mobility
entrepreneurship
and
participation


when
it
comes
to
the
future
the
report
captures
young
peopleâs
hopes
and
fears
about
deep
changing
societies

economies
as
well
their
recommendations

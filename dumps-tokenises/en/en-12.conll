covid

the
great
lockdown

asia
and

several
countries
in
asia
and
europe
where
the
covid
19
outbreak
appears
to
have
peaked
are
gradually
reopening
their
economies

without
a
vaccine
or
effective
treatment
policymakers
will
be
balancing
the
benefits
of
resuming
economic
activity
against
the
potential
cost
of
another
increase
in
infection
rates


they
face
difficult
choices
in
part
because
the
costs
of
erring
in
either
direction
could
be
very
large


the
timing
sequencing
and
pace
of
the
planned
exits
differ
across
countries


given
this
authorities
are
adopting
a
gradual
and
sequenced
approach
to
reopening
along
with
the
adoption
of
further
prevention
and
containment
measures


while
some
asian
countries
have
already
moved
down
this
path
with
some
success
risks
remain
and
the
risks
for
europe
may
be
even
greater


how
do
unlocking
strategies
compare
across
asia
and
europe


the
covid
19
pandemic
hit
asia
first


it
quickly
spread
from
china
to
others
in
the
region
and
has
yet
to
retreat
from
all
those
countries


to
date
over
250
000
people
in
south
and
east
asia
have
been
infected
and
9
700
have
died
with
china
india
indonesia
japan
singapore
and
south
korea
accounting
for
over
85
percent
of
all
infections


following
the
lockdown
in
china
in
late
january
and
a
proactive
containment
effort
of
testing
tracking
and
isolating
in
korea
these
two
countries
saw
new
infections
peak
in
february
just
when
the
pandemic
began
to
hit
europe
hard


the
number
of
confirmed
cases
of
covid
19
in
europe
has
now
reached
1

8
million
representing
almost
half
the
world
s
total


the
reported
death
toll
stands
close
to
160
000
out
of
more
than
280
000
worldwide


economic
impact
of
lockdown
measures
to
slow
the
spread
of
the
virus
most
european
and
asian
countries
adopted
strict
lockdowns
the
economic
impact
of
which
has
now
become
evident


china
s
gdp
dropped
by
36

6
percent
in
the
first
quarter
of
2020
and
korea
saw
an
output
decline
of
5

5
percent
all
rates
are
annualized
and
seasonally
adjusted



the
difference
in
impact
reflects
the
fact
that
china
faced
the
outbreak
first
and
then
moved
to
enforce
strict
lockdown
measures
while
korea
kept
the
economy
open
and
followed
a
strategy
of
more
targeted
containment
see
below



in
europe
gdp
declined
by
a
record
21

3
percent
in
france
19

2
percent
in
spain
and
17

5
percent
in
italy
in
the
first
quarter
of
2020
also
annualized
and
seasonally
adjusted



the
second
quarter
is
bound
to
be
even
worse


how
asia
is
restarting
economic
activity
as
containment
measures
proved
effective
in
curbing
the
epidemic
a
few
asian
countries
are
already
well
down
the
path
to
reopening


in
china
the
number
of
reported
new
infections
has
stabilized
at
very
low
levels


since
mid
february
the
government
has
been
reopening
the
economy
in
a
gradual
sequenced
manner


it
has
prioritized
essential
sectors
specific
industries
regions
and
population
groups
based
on
continuous
risk
assessments


meanwhile
it
has
also
been
leveraging
digitalization
big
data
and
technology
to
support
contact
tracing


crucially
the
effort
has
been
complemented
by
large
scale
testing
including
the
start
of
randomized
screening
in
select
provinces
and
systematic
tracking
via
mobile
phone
apps
to
rapidly
trace
the
contacts
of
any
new
positive
cases


this
has
been
accompanied
by
restrictions
on
movement
and
other
control
measures
on
infected
people
and
their
contacts


so
far
the
reopening
in
china
has
unfolded
without
a
debilitating
second
wave
of
infections
but
this
may
yet
change
as
activity
normalizes
further


korea
also
encountered
the
virus
early
in
the
global
wave
and
put
in
place
a
swift
and
well
organized
containment
effort


this
was
based
on
large
scale
testing
mandatory
isolation
of
detected
and
at
risk
cases
and
widespread
use
of
digitalization
and
technology
for
contact
tracing


this
effort
was
combined
with
the
closure
of
schools
and
public
facilities
comprehensive
guidance
on
social
distancing
and
quarantine
measures
for
travelers


however
domestic
mobility
and
business
activity
were
never
widely
restricted
in
korea


as
a
result
the
resumption
of
economic
activity
is
proceeding
gradually
and
more
or
less
automatically
as
social
distancing
recedes


the
authorities
have
transitioned
to
less
stringent
guidelines
for
"daily
social
distancing
"
which
directs
citizens
to
stay
home
when
feeling
ill
keep
personal
distance
wash
hands
frequently
wear
face
masks
and
ventilate
indoor
spaces
regularly


singapore
also
succeeded
in
containing
the
contagion
early
on
following
a
strategy
similar
to
korea
s


but
in
early
april
it
tightened
containment
measures
in
response
to
a
new
outbreak


europe
s
gradual
reopening
several
european
countries
have
announced
plans
to
gradually
reopen
their
economies
and
some
have
already
begun
the
process


the
timing
sequencing
and
pace
of
the
planned
exits
differ
across
countries
reflecting
differences
in
the
progress
of
the
epidemic
but
also
national
preferences
see
below



for
example
denmark
and
norway
have
started
by
reopening
lower
schools
and
services
while
spain
has
lifted
restrictions
in
manufacturing
and
construction
as
well
as
for
some
small
businesses
including
retail
with
safety
measures


germany
has
lifted
restrictions
on
retail
shops
and
is
gradually
re
opening
schools
with
the
relaxation
subject
to
a
break
mechanism
allowing
for
re
tightening
if
needed


italy
has
reopened
manufacturing
and
construction
under
strict
safety
rules
and
select
small
stores


france
has
just
allowed
the
reopening
of
primary
schools
shops
and
industry
on
a
differentiated
regional
basis
as
of
may
11


sweden
stands
out
with
its
distinctive
approach
and
its
decision
not
to
fully
lock
down
activity


it
is
too
early
to
tell
whether
this
strategy
will
prove
more
effective


all
countries
envisage
using
health
and
social
distancing
measures
to
mitigate
the
risk
of
a
new
wave
of
contagion
but
they
vary
by
type
and
intensity


unlocking
asia
and
europe
looking
ahead
while
reopening
strategies
differ
europe
appears
to
be
reopening
its
economy
earlier
in
the
epidemic
cycle
than
china


in
addition
the
capacity
for
large
scale
testing
contact
tracing
and
case
isolation
in
europe
may
lag
behind
the
best
examples
in
asia
partly
reflecting
stringent
privacy
rules


for
instance
the
european
commission
recommends
tracking
apps
but
only
on
a
voluntary
basis


consequently
europe
appears
to
be
more
at
risk
than
some
asian
countries
including
china
though
no
country
can
confidently
declare
victory
against
the
virus


in
both
europe
and
asia
lockdowns
and
other
restrictions
have
imposed
a
significant
economic
and
psychological
cost
on
citizens
and
their
desire
to
roll
back
these
measures
and
reopen
economies
is
all
too
understandable


however
moving
too
early
and
before
wide
reaching
measures
to
quickly
identify
and
contain
new
infections
are
in
place
would
put
the
gains
in
fighting
the
spread
of
covid
19
at
stake
and
risks
imposing
new
human
and
economic
costs


in
charting
their
path
out
of
this
unprecedented
lockdown
the
economies
in
asia
and
europe
should
proceed
carefully
and
resist
the
urge
to
do
too
much
too
soon
and
risk
a
relapse

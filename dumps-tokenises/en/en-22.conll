they
re
trying
to
fix
it


butler
said
hospitals
around
the
country
compare
notes
reassessing
their
disaster
response
plans
after
every
mass
shooting


that
was
especially
true
after
a
sniper
killed
58
people
and
injured
hundreds
more
at
a
country
music
festival
in
las
vegas
last
october


people
showed
up
at
the
city
s
hospitals
not
only
in
ambulances
but
also
in
cars
and
on
foot


some
of
the
medical
centers
were
not
used
to
treating
victims
of
severe
trauma


one
thing
hospitals
are
considering
is
whether
they
re
too
aggressive
about
lockdowns
said
butler
who
has
been
in
the
health
care
security
business
for
two
decades


sponsor

"sometimes
we
stay
in
these
elevated
lockdown
stages
longer
than
we

he
said


hospitals
are
also
lining
up
extra
staff
who
they
can
call
in
specifically
to
deal
with
crowds
the
people
who
are
there
because
of
an
emergency
and
the
visitors
who
would
ve
been
there
anyway


still
hospital

defend
lockdowns
as
an
important
precautionary
measure

orlando

painful
as

be
for

"our
first
and
foremost
responsibility
is
treating

and
that
overrides
everything
"

bryan

manager
for

health


his
private
hospital
chain
treated

2016


margeson
said
when
a
mass
casualty
incident
is
the

hospital
administrators
worry
about
worst

scenarios
such
as

suspect
coming

to
further
harm
victims
someone
trying

retaliate
against
a

big
crowds
of
people
rushing
emergency
rooms


so
when
there
s
a
crisis
at
his
hospitals
security
guards
patrol
the
entrances
questioning
people
about
why
they
need
to

what
is
a
soft
lockdown


written

editorial
team

about
our
editorial
process
answering
your
questions
about
key
school
safety
strategies
school
safety
is
a
top
priority
for
administrators
staff
and
families
alike


with
active
shooter
incidents
being
a
growing
concern
for
schools
creating
a
secure
learning
environment
has
never
been
more
crucial


effective
school
safety
requires
comprehensive
planning
clear
protocols
and
effective
safety
measures


in
this
blog
weâll
explore
the
different
types
of
lockdowns
commonly
used
in
schoolsâsoft
lockdowns
hard
lockdowns
and
code
red
lockdownsâalong
with
their
purposes
and
implementation
guidelines


additionally
weâll
discuss
common
school
safety
issues
and
provide
solutions
highlighting
alice
trainingÂ®
and
preparation
&
response
training
as
proactive
approaches
to
enhancing
school
safety


what
is
a
soft
lockdown


a
soft
lockdown
is
a
precautionary
lockdown
used
when
there
is
no
immediate
threat
inside
the
school
but
there
may
be
potential
risks
in
the
vicinity
such
as
police
activity
or
other
security
concerns


during
a
soft
lockdown
access
to
the
school
is
restricted
and
students
remain
indoors
continuing
their
activities
with
additional
security
measures


school
administrators
and
staff
monitor
the
situation
closely
and
external
doors
are
typically
locked
to
limit
access
from
the
outside


benefits
of
soft
lockdowns
*
allows
students
and
teachers
to
continue
classes
with
minimal
disruption


*
prevents
unauthorized
access
to
the
school
while
maintaining
a
calm
secure
environment


*
enables
staff
to
quickly
upgrade
to
a
hard
lockdown
if
the
threat
level
increases


soft
lockdown
vs


hard
lockdown
key
differences
while
a
soft
lockdown
is
generally
precautionary
a
hard
lockdown
is
implemented
when
there
is
an
immediate
threat
to
safety
on
school
grounds
such
as
an
active
shooter
or
a
violent
intruder


in
a
hard
lockdown
teachers
and
students
follow
strict
protocols
to
minimize
visibility
and
movement
locking
doors
turning
off
lights
and
hiding


this
level
of
lockdown
is
designed
to
protect
the
school
community
from
immediate
danger


in
summary
*
soft
lockdown
for
potential
external
threats
students
and
staff
remain
in
classrooms
without
high
restrictions


*
hard
lockdown
for
immediate
internal
threats
students
and
staff
secure
themselves
in
hidden
locked
areas


alice
trainingÂ®
from
navigate360
provides
options
based
response
training
to
enhance
lockdown
procedures
empowering
teachers
and
students
with
proactive
strategies
such
as
evacuation
or
barricading
depending
on
the
situation


what
is
a
code
red
lockdown


a
code
red
lockdown
is
the
highest
level
of
lockdown
often
associated
with
active
shooter
situations


this
protocol
signals
an
urgent
threat
to
life
and
requires
everyone
to
take
cover
barricade
themselves
and
remain
silent


communication
between
law
enforcement
and
school
administrators
is
critical
during
a
code
red
lockdown
to
ensure
a
coordinated
response


should
you
use
color
codes
in
emergencies


schools
sometimes
use
color
codes
like
code
red
code
yellow
or
code
blue
in
school
to
designate
different
types
of
lockdowns
or
emergencies


however
alice
trainingÂ®
does
not
recommend
using
color
systems
for
emergency
alerts


it
is
preferable
for
everyone
involved
to
communicate
specific
descriptive
information


for
example
describing
the
location
and
appearance
of
an
intruder
helps
everyone
respond
more
effectively


vague
color
codes
can
lead
to
confusion
especially
for
visitors
or
substitute
staff
who
may
not
remember
specific
color
meanings


descriptive
information
such
as
âthe
intruder
is
in
the
north
hallway
wearing
a
red
jacket
â
ensures
that
everyone
knows
exactly
where
the
threat
is
adding
an
additional
layer
of
safety
by
informing
the
intruder
that
their
location
is
known


common
school
safety
issues
&
solutions
schools
face
a
range
of
safety
challenges
from
external
security
threats
to
internal
behavioral
issues


addressing
these
effectively
involves
a
blend
of
physical
safety
measures
behavioral
management
strategies
and
strong
access
control


1


managing
access
to
school
grounds
uncontrolled
access
to
school
facilities
can
pose
significant
risks


schools
should
secure
all
entry
points
and
implement
access
control
systems
that
restrict
unauthorized
entry


these
systems
may
include
*
metal
detectors
screening
devices
at
main
entrances
to
detect
prohibited
items
and
enhance
school
security


*
visitor
management
solutions
tools
to
monitor
record
and
restrict
visitors
ensuring
only
authorized
personnel
access
the
school
grounds


navigate360
visitor
management
solution
provides
comprehensive
screening
approving
and
tracking
capabilities
schools
use
to
control
and
monitor
access
in
real
time

implementing
conflict
resolution
&
de
escalation
training
behavioral
issues
among
students
are
common
in
schools
and
can
escalate
into
conflicts


schools
can
address
this
through
conflict
resolution
and
de
escalation
training
equipping
staff
with
skills
to
detect
and
diffuse
aggression
effectively


navigate360
preparation
&
response
training
includes
courses
on
de
escalation
and
conflict
resolution
supporting
a
calm
respectful
school
atmosphere
that
benefits
the
entire
school
community

enhancing

through
alice

active
shooter
incidents
are
among
the
most
serious
threats
schools
may
face
necessitating
specialized

traditional

are
not
sufficient

the
face
of
an

alice
trainingÂ®
alert
lockdown

evacuate
offers
a
modern

preparedness


rather
than
relying
solely
on
traditional
lockdowns
alice
provides
options
to
evacuate
barricade
or
counter
depending
on
the
situation


by
training
staff
and
students
in
alice

schools
can
empower
individuals
to
participate
actively
in
their

ensuring
a
more

managing
active
shooter
&
other
emergency
drills
with
emergency
management
solutions
in
addition
to
alice
trainingÂ®
regular
active
shooter
drills
are
essential
to
ensure
that
staff
and
students
are
familiar
with
protocols
and
prepared
to
act
swiftly
during
a
crisis


conducting
these
drills
safely
and
effectively
requires
careful
coordination
and
tracking
especially
to
meet
compliance
requirements


emergency
management
solutions
assist
schools
in
managing
and
organizing
not
only
active
shooter
drills
but
all
required
safety
drills
such
as
fire
and
evacuation
drills


em
tools
provide
centralized
tracking
and
reporting
features
that
help
schools
stay
compliant
with
state
and
district
regulations
ensuring
that
drills
are
conducted
on
schedule
and
documented
accurately


this
proactive
approach
enables
schools
to
maintain
readiness
and
confidently
demonstrate
compliance
supporting
a
safer
and
more
prepared
school
community

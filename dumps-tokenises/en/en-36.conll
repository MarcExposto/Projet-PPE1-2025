all
the
later
covid
lockdowns
were
âunnecessaryâ
dominic
cummings
has
claimed


during
a
podcast
interview
with
the
spectator
published
this
week
the
former
number
10
chief
adviser
said
it
was
âunarguable
that
there
never
needed
to
be
any
lockdown
or
anything
approaching
a
lockdown
in
quarter
3
quarter
4
of
2020
or
in
2021â


had
the
government
learnt
more
quickly
from
its
early
pandemic
response
he
suggested
âthere
would
never
have
been
any
need
for
further
lockdowns
and
all
of
the
huge
economic
and
other
damage
that
they
did

â
cummings
who
was
working
for
then
prime
minister
boris
johnson
in
downing
street
when
britain
first
entered
a
national
lockdown
in
march
2020
told
the
spectatorâs
quite
right
podcast
that
the
initial
measures
were
âvery
differentâ
from
those
which
followed


âthe
first
[lockdown]
was
defensible
in
the
sense
of
there
was
no
system
there
was
no
testing
there
was
no
nothing
â
he
said


âall
the
officials
who
thought
they
had
the
worldâs
best
pandemic
plan
then
suddenly
admitted
to
us
âitâs
all
bollocks
and
there
is
no
plan


we
donât
know
what
weâre
going
to
do

ââ
according
to
the
uk
covid
inquiryâs
second
report
published
in
november
cummings
had
warned
johnson
in
march
2020
that
a
lockdown
was
required
in
london
to
stop
nhs
services
from
âcollapsingâ
within
days


the
political
strategist
reiterated
this
position
during
the
spectator
interview
arguing
that
the
nhs
âwas
overwhelmed
in
placesâ
and
that
âthereâs
no
hypothetical
world
in
whichâ
the
then
pm
would
have
gone
against
the
policies
of
other
european
governments
and
refused
to
impose
lockdown
that
spring


for
cummings
âsome
kind
of
short
emergency
measure
was
necessary
in
the
circumstances

â
britainâs
two
main
successes
during
the
covid
era
in
his
view
âwere
doing
vaccine
research
faster
and
doing
rapid
testingâ


if
âthe
system
had
got
its
act
together
properly
in
summer
2020
â
cummings
told
the
podcast
âyouâd
have
had
a
huge
rapid
testing
build
upâ
and
âabsolutely
no
need
for
lockdownsâ
later
that
year


while
he
stated
that
it
was
âvery
hard
for
me
to
see
how
the
first
one
could
have
been
avoidedâ
in
the
context
of
the
british
governmentâs
inadequate
preparation
cummings
acknowledged
that
âthere
would
definitely
would
have
been
no
need
for
the
first
lockdownâ
had
advisers
and
ministers
engaged
in
âproper
pandemic
planningâ


during
the
new
interview
cummings
also
criticised
the
covid
inquiry
which
he
accused
of
âcompletely
botch[ing]
its
reporting
over
the
whole
thingâ


he
added
âeither
itâs
confused
or
itâs
lying
â
who
knows
which
because
itâs
so
bad

â
the
inquiry
reported
last
month
that
the
adviser
âpoisoned
the
atmosphereâ
in
10
downing
street
during
the
response
to
covid
insisting
on
making
âkey
decisions
[â¦]
which
were
for
the
prime
minister
to
makeâ


speaking
to
the
spectator
cummings
claimed
that
âall
the
later
lockdowns
were
unnecessary
and
happened
only
because
the
pathological
system
itself
just
kept
collapsing
and
couldnât
find
its
way
out
of
that

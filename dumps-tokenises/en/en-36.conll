all
the
later
covid
lockdowns
were
"unnecessary"
dominic
cummings
has
claimed


during
a
podcast
interview
with
the
spectator
published
this
week
the
former
number
10
chief
adviser
said
it
was
"unarguable
that
there
never
needed
to
be
any
lockdown
or
anything
approaching
a
lockdown
in
quarter
3
quarter
4
of
2020
or
in
2021"


had
the
government
learnt
more
quickly
from
its
early
pandemic
response
he
suggested
"there
would
never
have
been
any
need
for
further
lockdowns
and
all
of
the
huge
economic
and
other
damage
that
they
did

"
cummings
who
was
working
for
then
prime
minister
boris
johnson
in
downing
street
when
britain
first
entered
a
national
lockdown
in
march
2020
told
the
spectator
s
quite
right
podcast
that
the
initial
measures
were
"very
different"
from
those
which
followed


"the
first
[lockdown]
was
defensible
in
the
sense
of
there
was
no
system
there
was
no
testing
there
was
no
nothing
"
he
said


"all
the
officials
who
thought
they
had
the
world
s
best
pandemic
plan
then
suddenly
admitted
to
us
`it
s
all
bollocks
and
there
is
no
plan


we
don
t
know
what
we
re
going
to
do


"
according
to
the
uk
covid
inquiry
s
second
report
published
in
november
cummings
had
warned
johnson
in
march
2020
that
a
lockdown
was
required
in
london
to
stop
nhs
services
from
"collapsing"
within
days


the
political
strategist
reiterated
this
position
during
the
spectator
interview
arguing
that
the
nhs
"was
overwhelmed
in
places"
and
that
"there
s
no
hypothetical
world
in
which"
the
then
pm
would
have
gone
against
the
policies
of
other
european
governments
and
refused
to
impose
lockdown
that
spring


for
cummings
"some
kind
of
short
emergency
measure
was
necessary
in
the
circumstances

"
britain
s
two
main
successes
during
the
covid
era
in
his
view
"were
doing
vaccine
research
faster
and
doing
rapid
testing"


if
"the
system
had
got
its
act
together
properly
in
summer
2020
"
cummings
told
the
podcast
"you
d
have
had
a
huge
rapid
testing
build
up"
and
"absolutely
no
need
for
lockdowns"
later
that
year


while
he
stated
that
it
was
"very
hard
for
me
to
see
how
the
first
one
could
have
been
avoided"
in
the
context
of
the
british
government
s
inadequate
preparation
cummings
acknowledged
that
"there
would
definitely
would
have
been
no
need
for
the
first
lockdown"
had
advisers
and
ministers
engaged
in
"proper
pandemic
planning"


during
the
new
interview
cummings
also
criticised
the
covid
inquiry
which
he
accused
of
"completely
botch[ing]
its
reporting
over
the
whole
thing"


he
added
"either
it
s
confused
or
it
s
lying
who
knows
which
because
it
s
so
bad

"
the
inquiry
reported
last
month
that
the
adviser
"poisoned
the
atmosphere"
in
10
downing
street
during
the
response
to
covid
insisting
on
making
"key
decisions
[





]
which
were
for
the
prime
minister
to
make"


speaking
to
the
spectator
cummings
claimed
that
"all
the
later
lockdowns
were
unnecessary
and
happened
only
because
the
pathological
system
itself
just
kept
collapsing
and
couldn
t
find
its
way
out
of
that

corporal
alan
fergusson
in
kenya
after
a
whole
night
on
exercise
a
scottish
soldier
has
told
how
he
has
drawn
from
his
experience
of
being
in
war
zones
in
afghanistan
to
get
through
the
coronavirus
lockdown


corporal
alan
fergusson
said
it
was
not
alien
for
him
to
live
in
a
small
space
without
being
allowed
to
leave
and
said
he
was
used
to
being
in
"unpleasant
situations"


the
38
year
old
from
2
scots
said
people
should
not
be
scared
of
coronavirus
but
instead
respect
it


he
said
"you
can
t
live
in
fear


in
this
lockdown
people
need
to
take
every
day
as
it
comes
and
realise
there
is
an
end
point


"this
lockdown
will
not
last
forever
so
people
need
to
pick
something
they
plan
to
do
at
the
end
and
focus
on
that
to
get
them
through


"i
m
focusing
on
our
next
deployment
to
afghanistan
in
october
as
mine


"you
also
have
to
focus
on
the
little
victories
you
have
each
day
and
find
a
hobby
you
like
doing
until
the
lockdown
is
lifted


"i
had
a
terrifying
job
in
afghanistan
and
how
i
made
it
through
each
day
was
thinking
each
night
when
i
was
in
bed
that
nobody
had
died
or
been
hurt
so
it
had
been
a
good
day


i
took
it
one
day
at
a
time

fergusson
can
only
train
half
the
numbers
due
to
social
distancing
rules
under
lockdown
when
corporal
fergusson
is
in
a
war
zone
such
as
afghanistan
he
only
has
a
house
with
a
small
garden
to
live
in
for
two
months
with
all
the
other
soldiers


he
said
"the
lockdown
is
comparable
to
operations
when
we
re
in
afghanistan
because
there
are
40
soldiers
in
a
little
compound
100m
sq
and
we
can
t
leave
or
we
will
be
shot


"being
in
lockdown
therefore
is
not
alien
to
the
guys
who
have
been
on
operations
and
in
iraq
the
platoon
houses
are
even
smaller


"so
being
in
a
small
space
is
not
alien
to
us


"in
this
lockdown
it
is
hard
to
see
an
end
point
because
of
the
fog
of
covid
but
it
is
there
and
it
will
end

he
said
living
in
the
army
barracks
was
very
different
now


he
said
"we
are
all
socially
distancing
the
parades
have
finished
and
our
commanding
officer
is
now
disseminating
commands
electronically
to
our
phones


"our
commanding
officer
would
normally
address
us
in
the
parade
square
to
us
in
lines
however
that
isn
t
happening
any
more

"
there
are
eight
men
to
a
flat
but
they
all
have
their
own
rooms
and
en
suites


there
are
queues
for
the
cook
house
now
and
all
the
chairs
have
been
moved
so
they
have
2m

during
a
tour
in
afghanistan
in
2013
he
said
"i
don
t
feel
lonely
because
i
can
still
see
people
and
there
is
still
the
camaraderie
and
we
have
afghanistan
to
work
towards
so
we
have
the
push


"soldiers
are
remarkably
good
at
adapting
and
taking
it
on
the
chin
and
use
dark
humour
when
in
any
unpleasant
situations


"but
we
are
also
already
used
to
structures
in
our
lives
so
that
has
helped
with
these
new
measures


"we
are
also
quite
good
at
doing
what
we
are
told

"
corporal
fergusson
said
"people
need
to
remember
nothing
lasts
forever
we
just
have
to
ride
out
the
bad
times
while
they
re
here
and
appreciate
the
good
times
while
we
can


there
are
always
more
of
both
to
follow

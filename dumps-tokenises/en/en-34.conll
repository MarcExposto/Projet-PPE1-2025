covid
19
and
states
of
emergency
09
april
2020
from
one
state
of
emergency
to
another
emergency
powers
in
france
2
years
and
less
than
5
months
after
the
end
of
the
two
year
state
of
emergency
triggered
on
the
wake
of
the
2015
terrorist
attacks
in
paris
a
brand
new
"state
of
health
emergency"
was
activated
in
france
on
the
23^rd
march
to
cope
with
a
new
attack
led
this
time
by
a
small
and
invisible
enemy
covid
19


the
so
called
"state
of
health
emergency"
currently
constitutes
the
legal
framework
and
basis
of
the
measures
in
force
to
cope
with
the
epidemic
including
nationwide
lockdown


what
is
this
new
regime


is
it
a
threat
to
individual
freedoms


what
are
its
limits
and
guarantees


was
it
legally
necessary


the
latter
question
is
all
the
more
relevant
that
the
french
legal
playbook
is
far
from
being
short
of
emergency
powers
regimes
1



it
makes
it
all
the
more
surprising
that
the
french
government
at
first
decided
that
it
could
act
without
triggering
any
of
the
textual
regimes
available
2
before
making
a
complete
u
turn
and
deciding
that
it
needed
a
brand
new
emergency
regime
dubbed
"state
of
health
emergency"

emergency
powers
in
france
a
quick
overview
1

1


the
state
of
siege
the
state
of
siege
was
originally
based
on
two
acts
of
1849
and
1878


it
has
been
introduced
in
the
french
constitution
in
1958
at
article
36
"the
state
of
siege
is
decreed
in
the
council
of
ministers


its
extension
beyond
twelve
days
can
only
be
authorized
by
parliament

"
the
1849
and
1878
acts
have
been
repealed
and
replaced
by
a
2004
ordinance
delegated
legislation
which
codified
the
state
of
siege
in
the
code
of
defence


the
triggering
of
the
state
of
siege
is
subject
to
the
existence
of
"imminent
danger
resulting
from
a
foreign
war
or
an
armed
insurrection

"
the
state
of
siege
is
an
emergency
regime
of
a
military
nature
as
soon
as
the
state
of
siege
is
decreed
the
powers
with
which
the
civilian
authority
is
invested
for
the
maintenance
of
order
and
police
are
transferred
to
the
military
authority


it
has
not
been
used
in
france
since
the
second
world
war

article
16
of
the
french
constitution
according
to
article
16
of
the
french
constitution
where
"the
institutions
of
the
republic
the
independence
of
the
nation
the
integrity
of
its
territory
or
the
fulfilment
of
its
international
commitments
are
under
serious
and
immediate
threat
and
where
the
proper
functioning
of
the
constitutional
public
authorities
is
interrupted"
the
president
of
the
republic
"shall
take
measures
required
by
these
circumstances"
including
measures
on
matters
which
are
ordinarily
reserved
to
the
parliament


there
is
no
substantial
limitation
apart
from
the
requirement
that
they
"shall
be
designed
to
provide
the
constitutional
public
authorities
as
swiftly
as
possible
with
the
means
to
carry
out
their
duties"
which
is
extremely
vague

the
state
of
emergency
the
state
of
emergency
act
has
been
adopted
by
the
french
parliament
on
the
3^rd
april
1955


it
has
been
activated
several
times
during
the
algerian
war
1955
1958
1961
secessionist
movements
in
new
caledonia
1984
riots
in
the
suburbs
of
paris
2005
and
finally
following
the
terrorist
attacks
in
paris
2015
until
the
1^st
november
2017


activating
the
state
of
emergency
implies
the
existence
of
an
"imminent
danger
resulting
from
serious
breaches
of
public
order
or
events
which
because
of
their
nature
or
severity
constitute
public
calamities"


the
state
of
emergency
is
declared
by
decree
in
the
council
of
ministers
i

e


signed
by
the
president
of
the
republic



it
cannot
be
extended
beyond
twelve
days
without
the
authorization
of
the
parliament


as
for
the
prerogatives
that
the
administration
has
under
the
state
of
emergency
listing
all
of
them
would
exceed
the
size
limit
of
the
present
text


let
us
just
say
a
few
things


first
the
government
does
not
necessarily
activate
all
of
them
and
not
necessarily
on
the
whole
of
french
territory


second
the
prerogatives
allowed
under
the
state
of
emergency
are
extremely
far
reaching
and
constitute
a
potential
threat
to
liberties

the
exceptional
circumstances
doctrine
the
exceptional
circumstances
doctrine
is
not
a
textual
but
a
jurisprudential
regime


it
appeared
under
the
name
of
"war
powers
doctrine"
in
two
rulings
related
to
the
circumstances
of
world
war
i
council
of
state
28
june
1918
heyriès
and
council
of
state
28
february
1919
dol
et
laurent



according
to
this
doctrine
in
the
presence
of
exceptional
circumstances
for
example
war
insurrection
or
natural
disaster
a
decision
or
action
of
the
administration
which
would
normally
be
considered
illegal
can
be
considered
legal
if
a
the
administration
has
been
unable
due
to
exceptional
circumstances
to
act
in
accordance
with
the
law
b
it
acted
in
consideration
of
an
essential
public
interest
and
c
the
breach
of
the
principle
of
legality
is
proportionate
to
the
other
interests
at
stake


administrative
courts
assess
these
conditions
on
a
case
by
case
basis


2


the
first
measures
against
the
epidemic
a
combination
of
health
emergency
police
and
exceptional
circumstances
doctrine
the
first
measures
both
restrictive
for
the
general
public
and
related
to
the
covid
19
crisis
were
adopted
by
the
health
minister
on
the
basis
of
article
l3131
1
of
the
public
health
code
"code
de
la
santé
publique"
hereafter
csp



on
the
basis
of
this
power
usually
referred
to
as
"health
emergency
police"
the
health
minister
adopted
the
ministerial
decree
of
14^th
march
2020
which
prohibited
public
access
to
a
certain
number
of
establishments
open
to
the
public
shopping
centres
restaurants
cinemas
theatres
museums
etc


banned
any
gathering
meeting
or
activity
bringing
together
more
than
100
people
in
a
closed
or
open
environment
and
prohibited
the
access
of
users
to
childcare
establishments
and
educational
and
higher
education
establishments


as
soon
as
the
16^th
march
the
nationwide
lockdown
was
decided
and
put
into
effect
on
the
next
day
at
noon


since
then
it
is
prohibited
for
every
person
to
move
outside
their
home
except
for
one
of
the
listed
reasons


people
wishing
to
benefit
from
one
of
these
exceptions
must
provide
a
"self
permission"
document
certifying
that
the
trip
in
question
falls
within
the
scope
of
one
of
these
exceptions


this
lockdown
was
decided
by
governmental
decree
2020
260
signed
by
the
prime
minister
the
health
minister
and
the
minister
of
home
affairs


the
legal
basis
of
this
decree
was
again
article
l3131
1
csp
which
was
not
legally
orthodox
since
as
we
have
seen
this
provision
vests
powers
in
the
health
minister
and
not
the
prime
minister


this
deviation
from
the
text
together
with
the
obvious
far
reaching
effects
of
a
nationwide
lockdown
probably
explains
why
the
decree
also
mentioned
the
exceptional
circumstances
doctrine
"given
the
exceptional
circumstances
arising
from
the
covid
19
epidemic"
in
its
recitals


however
this
mention
was
itself
somehow
unorthodox
since
it
is
for
the
judge
and
no
one
else
to
decide
whether
such
circumstances
exist
and
justify
the
decision


new
exceptions
were
added
by
the
governmental
decree
2020
279
of
19th
march


it
appears
therefore
that
governmental
authorities
have
found
all
the
legal
bases
they
needed
to
adopt
all
the
measures
they
deemed
required
by
the
circumstances


yet
the
government
felt
the
necessity
to
create
a
new
emergency
regime
the
state
of
health
emergency

the
enactment
of
a
new

overview
the
emergency
response
to
the
covid
19
epidemic
act
2020
290
adopted
under
the
accelerated
legislative
procedure
on
the
23^rd
march
2020
contains
various
measures
designed
to
cope
with
the
epidemic


however
i
would
like
to
focus
here
on
articles
1
to
8
of
the
act


these
provisions
create
a
new
emergency
regime
called
"state
of
health
emergency

"
this
regime
is
codified
in
the
public
health
code
csp
at
art


l


3131
14
to
art


l


3131
12


according
to
the
new
art


l3131
12
csp
"the
state
of
health
emergency
can
be
declared







in
the
event
of
a
health
disaster
endangering
by
its
nature
and
gravity
the
health
of
the
population

"
the
new
regime
does
not
replace
the
health
emergency
police
of
art


l3131
1
see
above
but
complements
it


according
to
art


l3131
15
in
the
territorial
districts
where
the
state
of
health
emergency
is
declared
the
prime
minister
can
by
regulatory
decree
taken
on
the
report
of
the
minister
in
charge
of
health
for
the
sole
purpose
of
guaranteeing
public
health
1


restrict
or
prohibit
the
movement
of
people
and
vehicles
2


prohibit
people
from
leaving
their
homes
subject
to
travel
strictly
essential
for
family
or
health
needs
3


order
measures
having
as
their
object
the
quarantine
of
persons
likely
to
be
affected
4


order
measures
for
placing
and
keeping
in
isolation
the
affected
persons
5


order
the
temporary
closure
of
one
or
more
categories
of
establishments
open
to
the
public
as
well
as
meeting
places
with
the
exception
of
establishments
providing
essential
goods
or
services
6


limit
or
prohibit
gatherings
on
public
pathways
as
well
as
meetings
of
any
kind
7


order
the
requisition
of
all
goods
and
services
necessary
for
the
fight
against
the
health
catastrophe
as
well
as
of
any
person
necessary
for
the
functioning
of
these
services
or
for
the
use
of
these
goods
8


take
temporary
measures
to
control
the
prices
of
certain
products
9


take
all
measures
to
make
available
to
patients
appropriate
medicines
10


as
necessary
take
by
decree
any
other
regulatory
measure
limiting
the
freedom
of
undertaking
for
the
sole
purpose
of
ending
the
health
disaster


on
the
same
day
governmental
decree
2020
293
was
adopted
on
the
basis
of
this
provision


for
the
most
part
it
rolls
over
with
even
further
restrictions
the
content
of
the
two
previous
lockdown
decrees
2020
260
and
2020
279

procedure
and
parliamentary
oversight
as
the
name
of
the
regime
suggests
the
state
of
health
emergency
mimics
the
"normal"
state
of
emergency
especially
from
the
procedural
point
of
view


for
example
according
to
art


l3131
13
"the
state
of
health
emergency
is
declared
by
decree
in
the
council
of
ministers"
i

e


presidential
decree
just
like
the
"normal"
state
of
emergency


however
art


4
of
the
act
states
that
"by
way
of
derogation
from
the
provisions
of
article
l


3131
13
of
the
public
health
code
a
state
of
health
emergency
is
declared
for
a
period
of
two
months
from
the
entry
into
force
of
this
act"


thus
in
the
present
circumstances
the
state
of
health
emergency
has
been
declared
by
the
act
itself
and
not
a
presidential
decree


also
just
like
the
"normal"
state
of
emergency
the
state
of
health
emergency
foresees
the
involvement
of
the
parliament


for
example
according
to
art


l3131
13
para
1
"the
national
assembly
and
the
senate
are
informed
without
delay
of
the
measures
taken
by
the
government
under
the
state
of
health
emergency"
and
they
"may
request
any
additional
information
in
the
context
of
the
control
and
evaluation
of
these
measures

"
however
and
for
no
clear
or
convincing
reason
this
involvement
of
the
parliament
is
in
certain
respects
more
limited
than
under
the
"normal"
state
of
emergency


for
example
according
to
art


l3131
13
para
3
the
extension
of
the
state
of
health
emergency
must
be
authorised
by
the
parliament
beyond
one
month
as
opposed
to
twelve
days
for
the
"normal"
state
of
emergency


other
difference
whereas
article
4
of
the
state
of
emergency
act
1955
provides
that
the
act
of
parliament
extending
the
state
of
emergency
lapses
at
the
end
of
a
period
of
fifteen
days
following
the
date
of
resignation
of
the
government
or
dissolution
of
the
national
assembly
there
is
no
such
caducity
for
the
state
of
health
emergency


therefore
if
a
newly
elected
assembly
wants
to
stop
the
state
of
health
emergency
it
has
to
adopt
an
act
for
this
purpose


the
state
of
health
emergency
like
the
state
of
emergency
stops
at
the
date
foreseen
by
the
parliament
in
the
act
of
extension


however
according
to
art


l3131
14
para
2
"the
state
of
health
emergency
may
be
terminated
by
decree
in
the
council
of
ministers
before
the
expiration
of
the
period
fixed
by
the
act
extending
it

"

judicial
review
since
the
decree
declaring
the
"normal"
state
of
emergency
is
subject
to
judicial
review
council
of
state
24
march
2006
rolin
and
boisvert
it
is
likely
that
the
decree
declaring
the
"state
of
health
emergency"
is
too
at
least
until
it
is
extended
by
an
act
of
parliament


however
in
the
present
circumstances
the
state
of
health
emergency
has
been
declared
by
the
act
itself
art


4
therefore
barring
without
necessity
any
judicial
challenge
of
the
declaration
itself
except
possibly
through
constitutional
review


by
analogy
again
with
the
state
of
emergency
council
of
state
9
december
2005
allouache
both
the
termination
of
the
state
of
health
emergency
by
decree
and
the
refusal
by
the
government
to
terminate
the
state
of
health
emergency
before
the
term
determined
by
the
parliament
are
probably
also
subject
to
judicial
review


however
available
precedents
concerning
the
state
of
emergency
see
allouache
suggest
a
minimum
judicial
review
limited
to
"manifest"
violation
of
the
law
in
maintaining
it
into
force
and
probably
also
conversely
in
terminating
it



measures
adopted
under
the
state
of
emergency
are
themselves
subject
to
judicial
review


how
thorough
this
judicial
review
may
be
remains
to
be
seen
but
one
may
have
certain
causes
for
concern


if
we
assume
that
the
intensity
of
the
judicial
review
on
measures
adopted
under
the
state
of
health
emergency
will
be
the
same
as
the
one
on
"normal"
state
of
emergency
measures
it
is
necessary
to
keep
in
mind
that
the
latter
has
raised
multiple
criticisms


furthermore
in
the
current
circumstances
the
council
of
state
has
not
so
far
proven
a
fierce
guardian
of
individual
freedoms


first
on
the
22^nd
march
2020
upon
an
application
from
a
doctors
union
for
interim
measures
it
ordered
the
government
to
consider
aggravating
the
existing
lockdown
measures
and
in
particular
"review
the
maintenance
of
the
exemption
for
"short
trips
near
the
home"
taking
into
account
major
public
health
stakes
of
the
confinement
order

"
second
consulted
on
the
act
when
it
was
only
a
bill
the
council
of
state
made
several
suggestions
to
aggravate
the
state
of
health
emergency
by
comparison
with
the
"normal"
state
of
emergency


it
is
for
example
the
council
of
state
which
suggested
para
17
of
its
opinion
to
depart
from
the
12
day
deadline
for
involving
the
parliament
in
favour
of
a
1
month
deadline
and
to
suppress
the
caducity
of
the
act
extending
the
state
of
health
emergency
if
the
government
resigns
or
if
the
national
assembly
is
dissolved


it
even
went
as
far
para
18
of
its
opinion
as
suggesting
the
suppression
of
the
provision
imposing
on
the
government
the
transmission
to
the
parliament
of
information
relating
to
the
implementation
of
the
state
of
health
emergency
a
suggestion
which
was
fortunately
not
followed
by
the
government


in
these
circumstances
one
may
be
forgiven
not
to
completely
trust
administrative
courts
in
general
and
the
council
of
state
in
particular
to
be
thorough
defenders
of
public
liberties

carnaby

taken
during
covid
19
lockdown
since
the
uk
first
entered
lockdown
on
march
23
2020
little
in
the
pandemic
has
attracted
so
much
attention
and
controversy
as
this
decision
to
grind
social
and
economic
life
to
a
halt


was
it
the
right
thing
to
do


properly
evaluating
the
effectiveness
of
any
health
oriented
treatment
be
it
a
new
medicine
vaccine
or
lockdown
measure
involves
comparing
its
introduction
with
a
counterfactual
situation
where
everything
is
the
same
except
for
whatâs
being
tested


this
is
why
medical
trials
have
a
control
group
whose
members
are
given
a
placebo
and
whose
characteristics
match
the
testing
group
as
closely
as
possible


unfortunately
this
isnât
possible
for
lockdowns


there
are
no
directly
equivalent
parts
of
a
country
or
the
world
that
can
act
as
true
test
and
control
groups
and
so
no
possibility
of
a
controlled
trial


instead
researchers
must
resort
to
other
methods
to
try
to
measure
lockdownsâ
effects


mathematical
models
can
be
used
to
produce
âwhat
ifâ
scenarios
where
applying
various
different
covid
control
measures
is
simulated
to
estimate
what
would
work
best
essentially
comparing
the
value
of
lockdown
to
other
measures
â
or
doing
nothing
at
all


such
models
are
very
useful
and
have
been
used
throughout
the
pandemic


however
theyâve
also
been
heavily
criticised
for
their
pessimistic
predictions
about
the
impact
of
the
virus


their
outputs
depend
on
making
assumptions
and
estimates
including
about
human
behaviour
which
is
notoriously
difficult
to
capture
accurately


an
alternative
is
to
use
a
data
driven
method
that
doesnât
rely
so
strongly
on
the
assumptions
of
models


for
example
the
âdifference
in
differenceâ
method
compares
outcomes
from
countries
or
regions
that
are
similar
in
all
respects
except
the
implemented
control
measures


a
common
approach
has
been
to
compare
data
from
us
states
that
differed
in
the
stringency
timing
and
extent
of
their
control
measures
but
otherwise
share
many
characteristics


but
of
course
this
runs
into
our
initial
problem


while
often
similar
no
two
states
arenât
directly
comparable


and
for
other
countries
like
the
uk
its
even
more
difficult
to
find
good
pairings
for
comparison


imperfect
assessments
clear
results
despite
these
difficulties
a
lot
of
researchers
have
worked
to
try
to
analyse
the
impact
of
lockdowns


while
accepting
that
no
method
of
assessment
is
perfect
most
published
studies
have
found
evidence
to
support
lockdown
measures
being
effective


they
also
point
out
that
different
actions
achieved
different
things
in
different
countries


graph

of

measures

estimates
of
the
effects
of
different
control
measures
on
the
number
of
new
covid
infections
during
the
first
epidemic
wave


the
different
dots
represent
different
ways
of
modelling
the
effects
of
control
measures
â
showing
that
how
you
choose
to
measure
impact
does
make
a
difference

by
limiting
gatherings
closing
businesses
with
high
exposure
rates
and
closing
schools
and
universities
effectively
reduced
the
spread
and
limited
deaths


these
places
are
associated
with
increased
transmission
rates
and
superspreader
events


have
you
read


*
covid
19
survivors
are
still
at
greater
risk
of

attacks
a
year
after

*
how
a
mix
and
match
vaccine
approach
could
boost
immunity
to
covid
19
*
why
donât
most
people
with
covid
need
to
test
for
another
30
days
even
if
theyâre
re
exposed


but
perhaps
surprisingly
stay
at
home
orders
appear
to
have
had
only
a
modest
effect
in
slowing
transmission


this
may
though
be
down
to
people
already
limiting
their
activities
voluntarily
before
being
told
to
do
so


closing
airports
somewhat
limits
the
disease
impact
but
land
borders
much
less


the
danger
of
delaying
so
were
lockdowns
appropriate
strategy
or
should
governments
in
future
rely
purely
on
voluntary
isolation


or
is
the
best
response
to
do
nothing


in
evaluating
the
2020
lockdowns
we
need
to
remember
that
the
decisions
were
taken
with
high
uncertainty
of
what
the
consequences
could
be


it
is
easy
to
criticise
the
scientists
and
politicians
in
hindsight
but
under
the
precautionary
principle
the
strongest
possible
measures
should
have
been
applied
given
the
unknowns
that
were
being
faced


despite
substantial
variability
across
countries
thereâs
little
doubt
that
lockdowns
successfully
slowed
covidâs
spread
in
spring
2020
reducing
cases
in
the
first
wave


thereâs
enough
evidence
to
show
that
countries
and
regions
that
quickly
introduced
substantial
and
multiple
restrictions
also
had
fewer
cases
and
deaths


compare
new
zealandâs
and
the
ukâs
responses


graph
showing
how
new
zealeand
introduced
stricter
control
measures
quicker
in
spring
2020
compared
to
the
uk
and
suffered
fewer
cases
and
deaths
as
a
result
new
zealand
locked
down
quicker
and
more
forcefully
in
the
spring
of
2020
â
resulting
in
fewer
cases
and
deaths


the
strength
of
lockdown
restrictions
is
measured
using
the
covid
response
stringency
index
developed
by
the
university
of
oxford
peopleâs
mobility
is
measured
via
anonymously
collected
data
from
mobile
devices


adam
kleczkowski
in
both
cases
the
introduction
of
lockdown
regulations
first
graph
above
resulted
in
a
rapid
drop
in
mobility
second
graph
above



reported
cases
peak
soon
after


deaths
in
turn
took
another
week
or
two
to
respond


but
new
zealand
responded
very
quickly
to
its
first
reported
case
with
its
lockdown
introduced
well
before
the
first
death
in
the
country


its
resulting
case
numbers
and
deaths
were
low


in
contrast
the
uk
delayed
its
lockdown
response
until
almost
two
weeks
after
its
first
death


although
british
people
reduced
their
mobility
before
lockdown
was
officially
introduced
the
virus
had
ample
time
to
spread


the
fact
that
delaying
lockdown
had
such
a
large
impact
is
further
proof
of
its
power
to
control
the
spread
of
the
virus


lessons
for
the
future
should
the
world
face
another
new
pandemic
disease
there
are
three
lessons
to
keep
in
mind


firstly
applying
protective
measures
as
early
and
hard
as
possible
consistently
led
to
better
outcomes


less
stringent
interventions
risked
increasing
deaths
more
severe
responses
lowered
fatalities


plus
unless
itâs
possible
to
eliminate
the
virus
in
a
region
measures
will
need
to
continue


this
requires
public
acceptance
and
economic
support
particularly
in
areas
of
high
deprivation


and
finally
for
the
greatest
effect
different
restrictions
must
be
combined
including
voluntary
responses
â
such
as
social
distancing
â
and
test
and
trace


thereâs
no
single
silver
bullet


some
measures
might
need
maintaining
even
after
for
example
introducing
vaccines


the
2020
lockdowns
demonstrated
that
societies
are
willing
and
capable
of
supporting
drastic
disease
control
measures
if
they
see
the
need


but
full
â
and
particularly
repeated
â
lockdowns
can
be
seen
as
a
failure
of
other
more
gradual
public
health
policies


a
lockdown
should
be
seen
as
an
efficient
but
also
very
blunt
public
health
tool
to
be
used
in
necessity
but
as
part
of
a
wider
strategy

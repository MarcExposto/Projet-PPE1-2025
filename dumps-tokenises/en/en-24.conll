quarantine
disambiguation



two
sealed
wards
of
east
birmingham
hospital
with
signs
informing
visitors
of
the
quarantine
a
quarantine
was
imposed
on
parts
of
east
birmingham
hospital
after
a
1978
smallpox
outbreak


a
quarantine
is
a
restriction
on
the
movement
of
people
animals
and
goods
which
is
intended
to
prevent
the
spread
of
disease
or
pests


it
is
often
used
in
connection
to
disease
and
illness
preventing
the
movement
of
those
who
may
have
been
exposed
to
a
communicable
disease
yet
do
not
have
a
confirmed
medical
diagnosis


it
is
distinct
from
medical
isolation
in
which
those
confirmed
to
be
infected
with
a
communicable
disease
are
isolated
from
the
healthy
population


the
concept
of
quarantine
is
known
to
have
been
practised
through
history
in
various
places


notable
quarantines
in
modern
history
include
the
village
of
eyam
in
1665
during
the
bubonic
plague
outbreak
in
england
east
samoa
during
the
1918
flu

during
the
1925
serum

the
1972
yugoslav
smallpox

pandemic
the
ebola
pandemic
and
extensive
quarantines
applied
throughout
the
world
during
the
covid
19
pandemic
since
2020


ethical
and
practical
considerations
need
to
be
considered
when
applying
quarantine
to
people


practice
differs
from
country
to

in
some
countries
quarantine
is
just
one
of
many
measures
governed
by
legislation

to
the
broader

etymology
and
terminology
[edit]
the
word
quarantine
comes
from
quarantena
or
quarantaine
meaning
"forty
days"
used
in
the
venetian
language
in
the
14th
and
15th
centuries
and
also
in
france


the
word
is
designated
in
the
period
during
which
all
ships
were
required
to
be
isolated
before
passengers
and
crew
could
go
ashore
during
the
black
death
plague

^[1]
the
quarantena
followed
the
trentino
or
"thirty
day
isolation"
period
first
imposed
in
1377
in
the
republic
of
ragusa
dalmatia
modern
dubrovnik
in
croatia


^[2]^[3]^[4]^[5]
merriam
webster
gives
various
meanings
to
the
noun
form
including
"a
period
of
40
days"
several
relating
to
ships
"a
state
of
enforced
isolation"
and
as
"a
restriction
on
the
movement
of
people
and
goods
which
is
intended
to
prevent
the
spread
of
disease
or
pests"


the
word
is
also
used
as
a
verb

^[6]
quarantine
is
distinct
from
medical
isolation
in
which
those
confirmed
to
be
infected
with
a
communicable
disease
are
isolated
from
the
healthy
population

^[7]
quarantine
may
be
used
interchangeably
with
cordon
sanitaire
and
although
the
terms
are
related
cordon
sanitaire
refers
to
the
restriction
of
movement
of
people
into
or
out
of
a
defined
geographic
area
such
as
a
community
in
order
to
prevent
an
infection
from
spreading

^[8]
history
[edit]
medieval
[edit]
the
mandatory
quarantine
of
special
groups
of
patients
including
those
with
leprosy
started
early
in
islamic
history

^[9]
a
hadith
going
back
to
the
islamic
prophet
muhammad
advised
individuals
present
in
a
region
with
a
plague
outbreak
to
remain
in
place
and
advised
healthy
individuals
to
avoid
traveling
there

^[10]
the
persian
muslim
polymath
avicenna
argued
for
controlling
"the
spread
of
diseases"
in
his
medical
encyclopedia
the
canon
[al
qanun]
of
medicine
published
in
1025


he
also
recommended
quarantine
for
patients
with
infectious
diseases
especially
tuberculosis

^[11]^[12]^[13]
in
the
early
8th
century
the
sixth
umayyad
caliph
al
walid
i
segregated
lepers
from
the
general
population
with
some
later
sources
crediting
the
caliph
with
opening
a
hospital


the
separation
of
lepers
from
the
general
population
was
also
practiced
in
the
moroccan
city
of
fez
where
lepers
were
relocated
to
a
cave
system
outside
of
the
city


dedicated
leprosariums
were
built
in
the
time
of
the
ottoman
sultan
murad
ii
in
the
15th
century
with
some
of
the
facilities
operating
for
centuries

^[14]
since
the
sixteenth
century
the
ottoman
empire
has
isolated
travellers
coming
from
epidemic
areas
during
the
bubonic
plague


a
quarantine
involved
isolating
healthy
travellers
for
a
period
of
time
so
that
it
could
be
ascertained
if
they
were
sick
or
not

^[15]
the
word
"quarantine"
originates
from
quarantena
the
venetian
language
form
meaning
"forty
days"

^[16]^[4]
this
is
due
to
the
40
day
isolation
of
ships
and
people
practised
as
a
measure
of
disease
prevention
related
to
the
plague

^[16]
between
1348
and
1359
the
black
death
wiped
out
an
estimated
30%
of
europe
s
population
and
a
significant
percentage
of
asia
s
population

^[16]
such
a
disaster
led
governments
to
establish
measures
of
containment
to
handle
recurrent
epidemics

^[16]
a
document
from
1377
states
that
before
entering
the
city
state
of
ragusa
in
dalmatia
modern
dubrovnik
in
croatia
newcomers
had
to
spend
30
days
a
trentine
in
a
restricted
place
originally
nearby
islands
waiting
to
see
whether
the
symptoms
of
black
death
would
develop

^[16]
in
1448
the
venetian
senate
prolonged
the
waiting
period
to
40
days
thus
giving
birth
to
the
term
"quarantine"

^[2]
the
forty
day
quarantine
proved
to
be
an
effective
formula
for
handling
outbreaks
of
the
plague


dubrovnik
was
the
first
city
in
europe
to
set
up
quarantine
sites
such
as
the
lazzarettos
of
dubrovnik
where
arriving
ship
personnel
were
held
for
up
to
40
days

^[17]
according
to
current
estimates
the
bubonic
plague
had
a
37
day
period
from
infection
to
death
therefore
the
european
quarantines
would
have
been
highly
successful
in
determining
the
health
of
crews
from
potential
trading
and
supply
ships

^[18]
other
diseases
lent
themselves
to
the
practice
of
quarantine
before
and
after
the
devastation
of
the
plague


those
affected
by
leprosy
were
historically
isolated
long
term
from
society

^[19]
quarantine
systems
were
enacted
to
prevent
the
spread
of
syphilis
in
zurich
in
the
15th
and
16th
centuries
^[20]
the
advent
of
yellow
fever
in
spain
at
the
beginning
of
the
19th
century
and
the
arrival
of
asiatic
cholera
in
1831

^[21]
venice
took
the
lead
in
measures
to
check
the
spread
of
plague
having
appointed
three
guardians
of
public
health
in
the
first
years
of
the
black
death
1348


^[22]
the
next
record
of
preventive
measures
comes
from
reggio/modena
in
1374


venice
founded
the
first
lazaret
on
a
small
island
adjoining
the
city
in
1403


in
1467
genoa
followed
the
example
of
venice
and
in
1476
the
old
leper
hospital
of
marseille
was
converted
into
a
plague
hospital


the
great
lazaret
of
marseille
perhaps
the
most
complete
of
its
kind
was
founded
in
1526
on
the
island
of
pomègues


the
practise
at
all
the
mediterranean
lazarets
did
not
differ
from
the
english
procedure
in
the
levantine
and
north
african
trade


on
the
arrival
of
cholera
in
1831
some
new
lazarets
were
set
up
at
western
ports
notably
a
very
extensive
establishment
near
bordeaux


afterwards
they
were
used
for
other
purposes

continued
throughout

and
plague
epidemics
affected
honolulu^[25]
and
san
francisco
from
1899
until

^[26]
state
governments
generally
relied
on
the
cordon
sanitaire
as
a
geographic
quarantine
measure
to
control
the
movement
of
people
into
and
out
of
affected
communities


during
the
1918
influenza
pandemic
some
communities
instituted
protective
sequestration
sometimes
referred
to
as
"reverse
quarantine"
to
keep
the
infected
from
introducing
influenza
into
healthy
populations

^[27]
additionally
the
nature
of
the
influenza
virus
that
caused
the
1918
pandemic
gave
rise
to
a
public
awareness
of
the
dichotomy
between
"crowd"
and
"home"
diseases


simply
quarantining
the
sick
in
isolation
was
ineffective
in
halting
the
spread
of
the
disease
and
new
quarantine
standards
that
extended
regulations
to
public
spaces
became
increasingly
more
common

^[28]
most
western
countries
implemented
a
range
of
containment
strategies
including
isolation
surveillance
and
the
closure
of
schools
churches
theatres
and
public
events

1911
people
were
prevented
from

the

empire
at
border
checkpoints
if
they
exhibited
symptoms
of
smallpox


those
who
discovered
symptoms
of
the
disease
after

ashanti
were
quarantined
in
remote

^[30]
in
the
1830s
both
the
ottoman
empire
and
egypt
established
new
quarantine
systems


in
1831
mehmet
ali
of
egypt
founded
the
quarantine
board
in
alexandria


in
1838
the
ottoman
government
installed
the
supreme
council
of
health
including
the
quarantine
administration
in
istanbul


these
two
institutions
set
up
permanent
quarantines
throughout
the
eastern
mediterranean
based
on
the
western
mediterranean
quarantine
model

^[31]
for
example
at
the
port
of
izmir
all
ships
and
their
cargo
would
be
inspected
and
those
suspected
of
carrying
the
plague
would
be
towed
to
separate
docks
and
their
personnel
housed
in
separate
buildings
for
a
determined
period
of
time


in
thessaly
along
the
greek
turkish
border
all
travellers
entering
and
exiting
the
ottoman
empire
would
be
quarantined
for
9
15
days


upon
appearance
of
the
plague
the
quarantine
stations
would
be
militarised
and
the
ottoman
army
would
be
involved
in
border
control
and
disease
monitoring

^[32]
international
conventions
1852
1927
[edit]
since
1852
several
conferences
were
held
involving
european
powers
with
a
view
to
uniform
action
in
keeping
out
infection
from
the
east
and
preventing
its
spread
within
europe


all
but
that
of
1897
were
concerned
with
cholera


no
result
came
of
those
at
paris
1852
constantinople
1866
vienna
1874
and
rome
1885
but
each
of
the
subsequent
ones
doctrine
of
constructive
infection
of
a
ship
as
coming
from
a
scheduled
port
and
an
approximation
to
the
principles
advocated
by
the
united
kingdom
for
many
years


the
principal
countries
which
retained
the
old
system
at
the
time
were
spain
portugal
turkey
greece
and
russia
the
british
possessions
at
the
time
gibraltar
malta
and
cyprus
being
under
the
same
influence



the
aim
of
each
international
sanitary
convention
had
been
to
bind
the
governments
to
a
uniform
minimum
of
preventive
action
with
further
restrictions
permissible
to
individual
countries


the
minimum
specified
by
international
conventions
was
very
nearly
the
same
as
the
british
practice
which
had
been
in
turn
adapted
to
continental
opinion
in
the
matter
of
the
importation
of
rags

the

the
signal
flag
"quebec"
also
called
the
"yellow
jack"
is
a
simple
yellow
flag
that
was
historically
used
to
signal
quarantine
it
stands
for
q
but
in
modern
use
indicates
the
opposite
as
a
signal
of
a
ship
free
of
disease
that
requests
boarding
and
inspection


plain
yellow
green
and
even
black
flags
have
been
used
to
symbolise
disease
in
both
ships
and
ports
with
the
colour
yellow
having
a
longer
historical
precedent
as
a
colour
of
marking
for
houses
of
infection
previous
to
its
use
as
a
maritime
marking
colour
for
disease


the
former
flag
used
for
the
purpose
was
the
"lima"
l
flag
which
is
a
mixture
of
yellow
and
black
flags
previously
used


it
is
sometimes
called
the
"yellow
jack"
but
this
was
also
a
name
for
yellow
fever
which
probably
derives
its
common
name
from
the
flag
not
the
colour
of
the
victims

ships
also
used
a
yellow
flag


^[16]
the
plain
yellow
flag
"quebec"
or
q
in
international
maritime
signal
flags
probably
derives
its
letter
symbol
for
its
initial
use
in
quarantine
but
this
flag
in
modern
times
indicates
the
opposite
a
ship
that
requests
free
pratique
i

e


that
declares
itself
free
of
quarantinable
disease
and
requests
boarding
and
routine
port
inspection

^[53]
ships
in

today
would
fly
either
the
q

alone
meaning
"my

ethical
and
practical
considerations
[edit]
the
quarantining
of
people
often
raises
questions
of
civil
rights
especially
in
cases
of
long
confinement
or
segregation
from
society
such
as
that
of
mary
mallon
also
known
as
typhoid
mary
a
typhoid
fever
carrier
who
was
arrested
and
quarantined
in
1907
and
later
spent
the
last
23
years
and
7
months
of
her
life
in
medical
isolation
at

^[55]^[56]
the
united

principles
[edit]
guidance
on
when
and
how
human
rights
can
be
restricted
to
prevent
the
spread
of
infectious
disease
is
found
in
the
siracusa
principles
a
non

document
developed
by
the

international
institute
for
criminal
justice
and
human
rights
and
adopted
by
the
united
nations
economic
and
social
council
in
1984

^[57]
the
siracusa
principles
state
that
restrictions
on
human
rights
under
the
international
covenant
on
civil
and
political
rights
must
meet
standards
of
legality
evidence
based
necessity
proportionality
and
gradualism
noting
that
public
health
can
be
used
as
grounds
for
limiting
certain
rights
if
the
state
needs
to
take
measures
aimed
at
preventing
disease
or
injury
or
providing
care
for
the
sick
and
injured


limitations
on
rights
such
as
quarantine
must
be
strictly
necessary
meaning
that
they
must
*
respond
to
a
pressing
public
or
social
need
health
*
proportionately
pursue
a
legitimate
aim
prevent
the
spread
of
infectious
disease
*
be
the
least
restrictive
means
required
for
achieving
the
purpose
of
the
limitation
*
be
provided
for
and
carried
out
in
accordance
with
the
law
*
be
neither
arbitrary
nor
discriminatory
*
only
limit
rights
that
are
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
seeking
to
impose
the
limitation

^[58]
in
addition
when
quarantine
is
imposed
public
health
ethics
specify
that
*
all
restrictive
actions
must
be
well
supported
by
data
and
scientific
evidence
*
all
information
must
be
made
available
to
the
public
*
all
actions
must
be
explained
clearly
to
those
whose
rights
are
restricted
and
to
the
public
*
all
actions
must
be
subject
to
regular
review
and
reconsideration


finally
the
state
is
ethically
obligated
to
guarantee
that
*
infected
people
will
not
be
threatened
or
abused
*
basic
needs
such
as
food
water
medical
care
and
preventive
care
will
be
provided
*
communication
with
loved
ones
and
with
caretakers
will
be
permitted
*
constraints
on
freedom
will
be
applied
equally
regardless
of
social
considerations
*
patients
will
be
compensated
fairly
for
economic
and
material
losses

australia
has
very
strict
quarantine
standards


quarantine
in
northern
australia
is
especially
important
because
of
its
proximity
to
south
east
asia
and
the

which
have
many
pests
and
diseases
not
present
in

for

the
region
from

to
broome
including
the
torres
strait
is
the
focus
for
quarantine
activities
that
protect
all

^[69]
as
australia
has
been
geographically
isolated

for

there
is
an

unique
ecosystem
free
of

that

in
many

^[70]
if

products
are

in

vessels
with

from

baltic

had
to
spend
forty
days
in

and
unpack

air
their
cargoes
but
due
to
complaints
mainly
from
edinburgh
and
leith
an
exception
was
made
for
grain
after
that
date


about
1788
an
order
of

required
every
ship
liable
to
quarantine
to
hoist

port
on

and
an
extensive
lazaret
was
built
on

were
ordered
to
be
sunk
with

animal
hides
were
suspected
of
harbouring

these
had
to
be
exposed
on
the
ship
s
deck
for
twenty
one
days
or
less
six
days
for
each
instalment
of
the
cargo
and
then
transported
to
the
lazaret
where
they
were
opened
and
aired
for
another
forty
days


the
whole
detention
of
the
vessel
was
from
sixty

sixty
five
days
including
the
time
for

imposed
a

on
a
palestinian
village
in
the

saturday
their

there
after
a

killed
two

in

operating
forcefully
against
terror
hubs
in
the
village
of
qabatiya







accompanied
by
a
lockdown
and
a
complete
cordon
around
the
locality
"
defense
minister
israel
katz
said
in
a
statement
published
by
his
office
on
saturday


"we
will
continue
to
pursue
an
uncompromising
offensive
policy
against
palestinian
terror
"
he
added


bilal
hunaisha
a
resident
of
qabatiya
south
of
jenin
in
the
northern
west
bank
said
the
town
"is
being
subjected
to
collective
punishment
by
the
israeli
occupation

"
"as
you
can
see
they
blocked
the
way
to
my
house
and
i
am
no
longer
able
to
move
around
"
he
told
agence

presse
pointing
to
a
pile
of
rubble
obstructing
the

in
the
attack
on
friday
a
34
year
old
palestinian
man
killed
two
people
in
northern

the
assailant
who
had
been
working

a
68
year
old
man
and
then
stabbed
an
18

and
the
shin
bet
domestic
security
agency
began
operating
in
qabatiya


they
searched
the
perpetrator
s
house
and
questioned
suspects
the
army
said


on
saturday
the
army
s
chief
of
staff
eyal
zamir
ordered
the
reinforcement
of
troops
deployed
in
the
area


"this
period
is
characterised
by
lone
attackers
and
individuals
staying
illegally
in
israel



enforcement
against
those
who
transport
and
employ
them
must
be
strengthened
and
improved
"
he
said
according
to
an
army
statement


"at
the
same
time
we
must
continue
to
enhance
our
capabilities
to
identify
and
thwart
these
attackers

"
qabatiya
resident
muhannad
zakarneh
told
afp
that
the
army
arrested
him
at
home
at
6
am
"for
no
obvious
reasons"
and
kept
him
handcuffed
for
hours


"when
i
asked
what
my
charge
was
there
was
no
response
"
he
said


the
official
palestinian
news
agency
wafa
reported
that
besides
blocking
entrances
and
conducting
interrogations
and
home
searches
israeli
forces
also
took
over
a
school
and
used
it
as
a
"detention
and
interrogation
center

"

the
start
of
the
war
in
gaza
following
hamas
attack
on
israel
in
october
2023
at
least
38

during
the
same
period
violence
has
also
surged
in
the
west
bank
which
israel
has
occupied
since
1967


israeli
troops
and
settlers
have
killed
more
than
1

including
many

as
well
as
dozens
of
civilians
according
to
an

10

epa
the
world
has
largely
moved
on
from
covid
except
for
china
where
towns
and
cities
are
still
shut
down
overnight


and
that
s
unlikely
to
change
soon
judging
by
president
xi
jinping
s
opening
speech
at
the
communist
party
congress
on
sunday


china
and
even
the
world
was
hoping
for
a
hint
of
relaxation


but
mr
xi
who
is
set
to
be
handed
a
historic
third
term
to
lead
the
party
said
that
the
government
would
not
"waver"
in
its
commitment
to
record
zero
cases


driven
by
mr
xi
s
approval
china
s
lockdowns
have
been
incessant
unpredictable
and
hellish
by
most
accounts


they
have
sparked
food
shortages
crippled
healthcare
access
hit
the
economy
hard
and
even
spurred
rare
signs
of
protest


but
beijing
has
clung
to
zero
covid
which
has
come
to
define
mr
xi
s
rule
and
the
authoritarian
bureaucracy
at
his
disposal
like
almost
no
other
policy


confuse
or
convince


the
bbc
found
that
since
march
china
has
partially
or
fully
locked
down
152
prefecture
level
cities
affecting
a
population
of
more
than
280
million


but
114
of
those
have
been
locked
down
just
since
august
as
the
party
congress
approached


beijing
is
the
only
major
city
to
have
avoided
a
full
lockdown
so
far


residents
half
jokingly
observe
that
the
capital
has
managed
this
by
locking
down
the
rest
of
the
country
when
needed


however
on
thursday
some
housing
estates
and
shopping
centres
in
beijing
were
being
locked
down
after
a
steep
rise
in
cases


bbc
gathered
data
starting
in
march
because
that
s
when
china
s
fourth
phase
of
covid
control
measures
kicked
off
comparing
lockdowns
across
phases
is
harder
because
official
language
changes
skewing
definitions
and
therefore
the
corresponding
data


and
china
s
bureaucrats
have
certainly
found
inventive
new
ways
to
describe
lockdowns


the
measures
had
become
so
controversial
and
dreaded
that
confusing
official
speak
was
one
way
to
make
them
more
palatable


so
they
used
phrases
like
"stasis
management"
"at
home
stillness"
or
to
be
clearer
"stillness
throughout
the
whole
region"
or
"stop
all
unnecessary
movement"


then
came
"temporary
societal
control"
which
authorities
said
was
not
a
"lockdown"
but
reduced
movement
that
somehow
would
not
affect
the
"normal
order
of
production
and
life"


and
yet
"the
public
was
asked
not
to
go
out
unless
necessary"


"enclosed
management"
was
another
new
phrase
invented
in
the
southern
province
of
guangdong


it
means
that
the
village
district
or
residential
compound
is
enclosed
with
checkpoints
at
entrances
and
exits


people
and
vehicles
are
allowed
to
enter
and
leave
with
passes


people
who
do
not
live
or
work
in
the
enclosed
area
are
not
allowed
to
enter


but
residents
were
told
it
s
not
a
lockdown


when
track
and
trace
methods
started
to
grate
eager
officials
came
up
with
an
alternative
"temporal
and
spatial
overlapper"


the
sci
fi
inspired
phrase
refers
to
someone
whose
location
tracked
by
their
phone
has
overlapped
in
time
and
space
with
someone
else
who
is
covid
positive


rather
than
tell
people
not
to
visit
their
hometowns
during
this
year
s
spring
festival
the
governor
in
dancheng
county
in
central
henan
province
warned
them
that
"those
who
come
home
with
malicious
intent
will
first
be
quarantined
then
be
detained"


now
china
is
in
what
beijing
calls
the
"scientific
and
precise
dynamic
zero"
phase
whose
meaning
no
one
seems
to
be
sure
about


it
s
meant
to
be
one
step
up
from
the
earlier
"dynamic
zero"
policy


dynamic
because
the
idea
is
that
it
s
not
just
about
locking
down
entire
cities
and
towns
but
about
responding
more
dynamically
depending
on
what
the
situation
requires


but
on
the
ground
it
just
looks
and
feels
like
a
series
of
endless
lockdowns


the
year
began
with
the
tourist
hub
of
xi
an
home
to
13
million
being
shut
down
for
a
month


then
in
march
a
lockdown
was
announced
in
shanghai


it
was
meant
to
last
less
than
a
week
but
its
25
million
residents
stayed
home
for
two
months


in
september
residents
in
locked
down
chengdu
found
themselves
trapped
in
their
apartments
during
an
earthquake


elsewhere
rescue
workers
were
required
to
do
a
covid
test
before
they
could
save
anyone

covid
19
outbreak
on
september
1
2022
in
chengdu
sichuan
province
of
china


getty
images
chengdu
was
among
several
cities
where
a
lockdown
caused
food
shortages
that
same
month
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
in
two
cities
in
shanxi
faced
a
lockdown
without
a
single
case
being
reported
officials
said
it
was
to
"contain
the
risk
from
outside"


a
local
party
leader
vowed
to
protect
the
area
"to
welcome
the
20th
party
congress
with
excellent
results"


pleasing
mr
xi
beijing
has
repeatedly
insisted
that
"dynamic
zero"
means
local
authorities
must
not
resort
to
a
"one
size
fits
all"
approach
of
full
lockdowns
and
mass
testing


but
there
appears
to
be
a
discrepancy
between
that
diktat
and
what
s
actually
happening
in
towns
and
cities
across
china


several
lockdowns
announced
by
local
officials
were
in
fact
missing
from
beijing
s
daily
announcements
in
march
and
april
including
one
in
shenzhen
which
confined
17
million
to
their
homes
for
a
week


it
s
possible
central
government
officials
did
not
want
to
encourage
total
lockdowns
by
drawing
attention
to
them
while
local
officials
preferred
to
use
them
to
control
outbreaks
swiftly


experts
also
say
china
s
bureaucracy
is
far
more
centralised
under
mr
xi
it
s
a
reversal
of
the
decentralisation
that
began
after
china
introduced
economic
reforms


what
that
means
now
is
that
bureaucrats
enforce
mr
xi
s
signature
policies
with
zeal


"xi
s
appetite
for
adaptive
governance
and
his
relationship
with
local
authorities
varies
by
issue
areas
"
says
yuen
yuen
ang
a
political
science
associate
professor
at
the
university
of
michigan


"on
his
signature
policies
those
he
declared
as
having
no
room
for
wavering
there
is
little
or
no
leeway
for
local
governments
to
make
adjustments


indeed
to
survive
and
get
ahead
they
must
over
implement
xi
s
personal
edicts
with
gusto
even
if
the
net
result
is
damaging

"
from
april
onwards
the
lockdown
tallies
in
beijing
s
announcements
matched
those
in
local
notices
around
the
same
time
mr
xi
reaffirmed
his
support
for
sticking
to
a
zero
covid
approach


as
the
year
wore
on
more
cities
stopped
meticulous
track
and
trace
and
entered
full
lockdowns
even
if
only
a
handful
of
cases
were
reported


local
officials
are
driven
by
both
fear
of
punishment
and
an
urge
to
display
loyalty
to
mr
xi
says
wu
guoguang
a
senior
china
scholar
at
stanford
university


he
was
once
a
member
of
the
chinese
communist
party
s
policy
group
on
political
reform


when
it
comes
to
proving
their
loyalty
mr
wu
adds
"there
is
an
undeclared
competition
among
local
leaders
which
provides
a
huge
momentum
to
their
seemingly
unreasonable
measures

"
it
s
all
political
and
experts
say
it
s
no
coincidence
that
the
lockdowns
started
to
spread
as
the
congress
approached

march
and
12

2022


there
has
been
a
measurable
increase
in
city
lockdowns
since
august


"covid
is
political
in
china
"
says
william
hurst
professor
of
chinese
development
at
cambridge
university


the
carefully
scripted
once
in
five
years
party
congress
carries
special
import
this
year
if
it
goes
according
to
mr
xi
s
plan
he
becomes
the
first
leader
since
the
first
communist
era
leader
mao
zedong
to
serve
as
party
boss
for
a
third
term


and
nothing
can
ruin
the
party
quite
like
a
covid
outbreak
especially
since
mr
xi
and
his
bureaucrats
insist
"dynamic
zero"
is
a
success
that
has
been
saving
lives


it
has
indeed
prevented
a
major
outbreak
like
the
one
in
shanghai
earlier
this
year
says
benjamin
cowling
chair
of
epidemiology
at
the
university
of
hong
kong


"what
is
less
certain
is
whether
the
cost
is
justified
and
whether
this
approach
is
going
to
be
sustainable
given
its
enormous
economic
costs
"
he
adds


locking
down
millions
of
people
may
be
helping
keep
national
case
counts
low
but
the
decision
to
do
so
even
as
the
rest
of
the
world
opens
up
also
shows
how
poorly
prepared
china
is
for
a
post
covid
world

a
spring
peak
has
tailed
off
significantly
public
health
experts
argue
that
if
zero
covid
was
indeed
about
saving
lives
beijing
would
have
implemented
a
more
vigorous
vaccine
policy
like
other
countries


but
china
has
refused
to
import
vaccines
despite
evidence
that
its
homemade
jabs
haven
t
proved
as
effective


and
unvaccinated
elderly
people
who
beijing
says
it
s
trying
to
protect
with
zero
covid
have
died

the
virus


but
what
zero
covid
has
done
experts
say
is
project
a
veneer
of
control
and
stability
as
the
year
s
biggest
political
event
unfolds


prof
hurst
expects
the
intermittent
lockdowns
to
last
at

until
march
next
year
when
china
s
equivalent

parliament
convenes

xi

for
a

"lockdowns
prevent
covid

"
prof

adds

incredibly
strict

lockdown
and
intruder
situations
are
becoming
more
common
in
schools


at
little
green
button
weâre
seeing
an
increase
in
demand
for
solutions
to
deal
with
these
emergencies


this
is
in
line
with
recent
reports
that
88%
of
schools
are
investing
in
security
measures
to
prevent
crime
in
and
around
their
premises


while
the
risk
of
an
incident
involving
an
intruder
looking
to
cause
harm
in
any
school
is
very
low
itâs
still
vital
that
every
school
in
the
uk
has
a
clear
well
practised
lockdown
procedure
in
place
and
has
the
tools
to
implement
it
swiftly
and
safely


with
the
terrorism
protection
of
premises
bill
known
as
martynâs
law
due
to
come
into
force
in
2027
schools
will
be
expected
to
place
even
more
focus
on
emergency
planning
risk
awareness
and
response


while
schools
arenât
considered
to
be
among
the
highest
risk
venues
the
principles
of
this
new
legislation
already
align
with
ofstedâs
expectations
for
safeguarding
and
site
security


in
this
guide
weâll
explore
the
practical
steps
schools
can
take
to
put
an
effective
lockdown
procedure
in
place


from
assessing
your
site
for
vulnerabilities
to
choosing
the
right
alert
system
weâll
guide
you
through
the
key
considerations
for
keeping
pupils
staff
and
visitors
safe
during
a
lockdown
or

situation

procedures

what
is
a

lockdown
and
why
should
you
have
a
lockdown
procedure


a
school
lockdown
often
referred
to
as
a
school
security
lockdown
in
government
documents
is
when
there
is
a
threat
to
pupils
staff
and
visitors
that
means
itâs
safer
for
them
to
remain
in
a
school
building
and
are
therefore
directed
to
stay
there
and
shelter
as
far
away
from
the
threat
as
possible


situations
when
a
lockdown
may
be
used
include
*
when
an
intruder
is
seen
on
the
school
grounds
or
in
the
building
*
when
a
violent
or
abusive
parent/carer
is
causing
trouble
*
when
a
threat
has
been
made
against
the
school
you
may
have
also
heard
of
the
term
âinvacuationâ


a
lockdown
is
similar
to
an
invacuation
but
they
are
used
in
different
circumstances


while
a
lockdown
is
used
when
there
is
the
risk
of
immediate
harm
to
pupils
staff
or
visitors
an
invacuation
is
used
when
there
is
danger
outside
the
school
that
needs
to
be
avoided


invacuations
can
be
useful
in
situations
such
as
*
loose
animals
on
school
grounds
*
gas
smoke
or
other
chemical
pollution
in
the
area
*
any
incident
near
the
school
which
has
the
potential
to
cause
harm
if
pupils
staff
or
visitors
leave
the
building
every
school
should
have
a
lockdown
and
invacuation
procedure
in
place
that
clearly
states
the
steps
that
staff
must
take
to
protect
pupils
visitors
and
themselves
from
any
threat


ofsted
requires
all
schools
to
have
a
security
lockdown
procedure
while
the
terrorism
protection
of
premises
bill
which
comes
into
force
in
2027
aims
to
ensure
that
publicly
accessible
venues
have
plans
in
place
to
protect
the
public
from
terrorist
threats


what
does
ofsted
say
about
lockdown
procedures

empty

with
large
windows
and
a
circular
desk
in
the
middle


an
empty
classroom
with
large
windows
and
a
circular
desk
in
the
middle


ofstedâs
guidance
on
lockdown
procedures
is
vague
and
many
unions
such
as
nasuwt
argue
that
there
should
be
much
more
advice
available
to
headteachers


ofsted
states
that
every
school
should
have
a
security
lockdown
plan
and
it
is
the
responsibility
of
the
headteacher
or
delegated
member
of
staff
to
judge
the
level
of
response
required
during
a
security
incident


right
now
ofsted
inspectors
do
not
advocate
for
the
need
for
lockdown
alarms
in
schools
despite
some
online
sources
reporting
that
they
do


the
school
inspection
handbook
only
states
that
they
expect
schools
to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
keeping
children
safe
in
education
guidance


however
we
think
that
ofsted
and
the
department
for
education
should
go
further
and
require
a
lockdown
alarm
system
to
be
in
place
in
order
to
protect
students
and
staff


currently
many
schools
rely
on
their
fire
alarm
system
which
can
often
produce
visual
only
alarms


but
we
think
this
is
dangerous
â
fire
alarms
signal
evacuation
whereas
in
a
lockdown
situation
itâs
crucial
that
staff
and
pupils
stay
put


martynâs
law
how
it
relates
to
schools
the
terrorism
protection
of
premises
bill
more
commonly
known
as
martynâs
law
was
created
in
memory
of
martyn
hett
one
of
the
victims
of
the
2017
manchester
arena
attack


this
legislation
is
due
to
come
into
force
in
2027
and
will
place
new
duties
on
publicly
accessible
venues
to
consider
the
threat
of
terrorism
and
put
appropriate
protective
measures
in
place


while
most
schools
are
not
considered
high
risk
venues
under
the
current
classification
of
the
bill
the
core
principles
of
martynâs
law
still
apply


these
include
*
risk
awareness
understanding
potential
threats
and
being
able
to
recognise
suspicious
behaviour
or
activity


*
emergency
planning
having
clear
documented
procedures
in
place
to
respond
to
different
types
of
incidents


*
rapid
response
ensuring
that
all
staff
know
what
to
do
in
the
event
of
an
emergency
and
can
act
quickly
to
protect
pupils


ofsted
has
already
started
to
align
with
these
principles
in
its
inspection
framework


having
a
school
lockdown
procedure
is
a
clear
way
to
demonstrate
that
your
school
takes
its
duty
of
care
seriously
â
and
helps
ensure
youâre
prepared
for
a
range
of
incidents
not
just
terrorism


how
to
create
a
lockdown
procedure
if
your
school
doesnât
yet
have
a
formal
lockdown
plan
in
place
now
is
the
time
to
act


weâve
spoken
to
some
of
our
customers
in
the
education
sector
and
interpreted
nasuwt
guidance
to
come
up
with
these
guidelines
for
creating
a
lockdown
procedure


this
is
for
informational
purposes
only


please
ensure
you
liaise
with
your
local
authority
unions
and
other
relevant
bodies
to
help
finalise
your
lockdown
procedure

conduct
a
vulnerability
assessment
two
sets
of
hands
observing
a
building
plan


two
sets
of
hands
observing
a
building
plan


begin
by
identifying
the
specific
risks
that
your
school
could
face


this
might
include
intruders
violent
or
aggressive
individuals
or
incidents
happening
in
the
local
area


consider
different
times
of
the
school
day
such
as
break
times
or
drop
off
when
pupils
may
be
more
dispersed
across
the
site


nasuwt
recommends
carrying
out
a
vulnerability
assessment
of
your
schoolâs
buildings
and
grounds
using
a
traffic
light
system


it
can
be
useful
to
put
yourself
in
the
position
of
the
attacker
while
you
do
this


using
a
plan
of
your
schoolâs
grounds
walk
around
the
school
and
consider
how
an
attacker
might
carry
out
an
attack
and
where
the
easiest
places
to
gain
access
are


highlight
areas
of
the
school
in
red
amber
or
green
depending
on
how
vulnerable
they
are
to
attack
â
with
red
being
the
most
vulnerable

do
a
space
assessment
hopefully
once
youâve
assessed
each
area
youâll
have
some
highlighted
in
green


these
areas
should
be
the
most
likely
to
provide
protection
or
are
difficult
to
find


do
a
space
assessment
in
each
area
allowing
around
half
a
metre
squared
per
person
to
calculate
how
many
people
you
can
fit
in
the
area


if
you
donât
have
enough
space
in
the
green
areas
you
may
have
to
consider
using
some
of
the
safer
amber
ones
too


you
should
consider
the
following
things
when
deciding
on
the
areas
to
be
used
*
try
to
move
people
short
distances
as
longer
routes
can
lead
to
panic
*
the
routes
to
safe
areas
also
need
to
be
safe
so
donât
take
people
outside
to
move
back
inside
to
a
safe
area
*
people
should
be
kept
informed
every
few
minutes
when
they
are
sheltering
in
these
areas
â
this
is
where
an
alert
system
like
little
green
button
can
be
useful
*
ideally
there
should
be
toilets
and
water
facilities
nearby
*
nasuwt
suggests
that
classes
that
know
and
work
together
are
best
kept
together
to
lower
stress

write
your
lockdown
procedure
now
you
know
where
you
can
safely
accommodate
people
during
a
lockdown
itâs
time
to
write
your
lockdown
procedure


your
procedure
should
be
simple
enough
to
follow
under
stress
and
flexible
enough
to
work
during
different
parts
of
the
school
day
such
as
pupil
arrival
break
times
or
after
school
clubs


there
are
three
key
principles
to
consider
when
writing
your
procedure
time
control
and
simplicity


time
time
is
of
the
essence
in
a
lockdown
situation


just
like
in
a
fire
the
sooner
people
are
made
aware
of
the
incident
the
faster
they
can
respond


thatâs
why
schools
should
consider
using
a
dedicated
lockdown
alert
system
that
is
clearly
distinguishable
from
the
fire
alarm
to
avoid
confusion


ideally
a
panic
alarm
should
be
placed
in
vulnerable
red
areas
such
as
entrances
the
main
office
or
reception


if
you
also
use
a
pa
system
or
internal
messaging
this
can
help
qualify
the
alert
and
direct
staff
to
take
the
appropriate
action


at
little
green
button
we
recommend
a
customisable
lockdown
alert
that
can
be
triggered
discreetly
via
desktop
mobile
or
a
physical
button
and
which
can
send
different
types
of
alerts
to
the
right
responders
immediately


control
without
clear
leadership
lockdown
situations
can
quickly
become
chaotic


every
school
should
nominate
an
incident
controller
to
take
charge
when
a
lockdown
is
triggered


to
ensure
someone
is
always
available
at
least
three
trained
individuals
should
be
appointed
and
rotated
depending
on
availability


these
roles
may
be
filled
by
members
of
slt
or
other
trained
staff
who
are
regularly
on
site


to
improve
communication
consider
issuing
a
pager
or
a
designated
mobile
phone
to
the
duty
controller
each
day


the
controller
should
have
access
to
key
tools
such
as
the
pa
system
cctv
and
any
lockdown
alert
technology


ideally
this
would
be
done
from
a
control
room
or
protected
office


if
your
current
control
setup
is
located
in
a
vulnerable
area
you
may
want
to
explore
cost
effective
ways
to
upgrade
security
or
set
up
duplicate
facilities
elsewhere
on
site


simplicity
procedures
must
be
kept
clear
and
easy
to
follow


in
the
middle
of
a
high
stress
incident
complicated
or
vague
steps
can
lead
to
delays
or
mistakes


use
plain
language
and
break
down
the
steps
for
different
groups
such
as
class
teachers
support
staff
and
admin
staff


one
effective
approach
is
to
build
your
lockdown
procedure
on
top
of
your
existing
fire
marshal
system


fire
marshals
already
have
responsibility
for
guiding
and
accounting
for
pupils
during
fire
evacuations
so
with
a
small
amount
of
additional
training
they
can
be
equipped
to
support
lockdown
scenarios
too


regular
practise
will
help
staff
feel
more
confident
in
their
roles
during
a
real
incident


keep
procedures
short
action
focused
and
revisit
them
after
drills
or
policy
reviews


4


regular
practise
and
drills
thereâs
no
specific
legal
requirement
to
conduct
lockdown
drills
in
schools
but
itâs
considered
best
practice
by
both
ofsted
and
government
safeguarding
guidance


drills
should
be
held
at
least
once
a
year
and
after
any
significant
change
to
your
policy
or
procedures


ensure
all
new
staff
are
trained
in
your
lockdown
procedures
as
part
of
their
induction


why
a
lockdown
alert
system
should
be
part
of
your
lockdown
procedure
a
clear
unmistakable
way
to
alert
staff
to
a
lockdown
situation
is
critical


many
schools
rely
on
their
fire
alarm
systems
to
signal
emergencies
but
this
can
create
confusion


fire
alarms
tell
staff
and
pupils
to
evacuate


a
lockdown
alarm
must
do
the
opposite
instruct
them
to
stay
inside
and
take
shelter


the
national
counter
terrorism
security
office
nactso
specifically
advises
against
using
fire
alarms
during
lockdown
events
as
they
can
lead
to
the
wrong
response
and
place
staff
and
pupils
in
danger


instead
schools
should
install
a
dedicated
lockdown
alert
system
that
*
notifies
staff
immediately
without
causing
panic
among
pupils
*
can
be
triggered
from
different
areas
of
the
school
*
clearly
distinguishes
a
lockdown
from
other
types
of
emergency

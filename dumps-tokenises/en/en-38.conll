the

covid
19
pandemic
also
known
as
the
coronavirus
pandemic
caused
by
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
2
sars
cov
2
began
with
an
outbreak
in
wuhan
china
in
december
2019


soon
afterward
it
spread
to
other
parts
of
asia
and
then
worldwide
in
early
2020


the
world
health
organization
who
declared
the
outbreak
a
public
health
emergency
of
international
concern
pheic
on
30
january
2020
and
assessed
it
as
having
become
a
pandemic
on
11
march

^[3]
the
who
declared
the
public
health
emergency
caused
by
covid
19
had
ended
in
may
2023

^[4]
covid
19
symptoms
range
from
asymptomatic
to
deadly
but
most
commonly
include
fever
sore
throat
nocturnal
cough
and
fatigue


transmission
of
the
virus
is
often
through
airborne
particles


mutations
have
produced
many
strains
variants
with
varying
degrees
of
infectivity
and
virulence

^[11]
covid
19
vaccines
were
developed
rapidly
and
deployed
to
the
general
public
beginning
in
december
2020
made
available
through
government
and
international
programmes
such
as
covax
aiming
to
provide
vaccine
equity


treatments
include
novel
antiviral
drugs
and
symptom
control


common
mitigation
measures
during
the
public
health
emergency
included
travel
restrictions
lockdowns
business
restrictions
and
closures
workplace
hazard
controls
mask
mandates
quarantines
testing
systems
and
contact
tracing
of
the
infected


the
pandemic
caused
severe
social
and
economic
disruption
around
the
world
including
the
largest
global
recession
since
the
great
depression

^[12]
widespread
supply
shortages
including
food
shortages
were
caused
by
supply
chain
disruptions
and
panic
buying


reduced
human
activity
led
to
an
unprecedented
temporary
decrease
in
pollution


educational
institutions
and
public
areas
were
partially
or
fully
closed
in
many
jurisdictions
and
many
events
were
cancelled
or
postponed
during
2020
and
2021


telework
became
much
more
common
for
white
collar
workers
as
the
pandemic
evolved


misinformation
circulated
through
social
media
and
occasionally
through
mass
media
and
political
tensions
intensified


the
pandemic
raised
issues
of
racial
and
geographic
discrimination
health
equity
and
the
balance
between
public
health
imperatives
and
individual
rights


the
disease
has
continued
to
circulate
since
2023


as
of
2024
experts
were
uncertain
as
to
whether
it
still
qualified
as
a
pandemic

^[13]^[14]
different
definitions
of
pandemics
lead
to
different
determinations
of
when
they
end

pandemic
in
epidemiology
a
pandemic
is
defined
as
"an
epidemic
occurring
over
a
very
wide
area
crossing
international
boundaries
and
usually
affecting
a
large
number
of
people"


during
the
covid
19
pandemic
as
with
other
pandemics
the
meaning
of
this
term
has
been
challenged

^[16]
the
end
of
a
pandemic
or
other
epidemic
only
rarely
involves
the
total
disappearance
of
a
disease
and
historically
much
less
attention
has
been
given
to
defining
the
ends
of
epidemics
than
their
beginnings


the
ends
of
particular
epidemics
have
been
defined
in
a
variety
of
ways
differing
according
to
academic
field
and
differently
based
on
location
and
social
group


an

containment
is
undertaken
to
stop

into

isolated

the

isolated

ensure
that

screening

starting
point

"the
strategy
of
control

zero
covid
has
been
implemented
successfully
in
a
number
of
countries


the
objective
of
this
strategy
is
to
keep
transmission
of
the
virus
as
close
to
zero
as
possible
and
ultimately
to
eliminate
it
entirely
from
particular
geographical
areas


the
strategy
aims
to
increase
the
capacity
to
identify
and
trace
chains
of
transmission
and
to
identify
and
manage
outbreaks
while
also
integrating
economic
psychological
social
and
healthcare
support
to
guarantee
the
isolation
of
cases
and
contacts


this
approach
is
also
known
as
"find

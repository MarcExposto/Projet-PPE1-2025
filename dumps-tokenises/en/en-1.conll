emergency
protocol
that
prevents
people
from
leaving
or
entering
a
location
this

is
about
the
emergency
measure


for
the
mass
quarantine
measure
in
a
disease
outbreak
see

a
lockdown
/|la

kdaun/
^i
o
is
a
restriction
policy
for
people
community
or
a
country
to
stay
where
they
are
usually
due
to
specific
risks
that
could
possibly
harm
the
people
if
they
move
and
interact
freely


the
term
is
used
for
a
prison
protocol
that
usually
prevents
people
information
or
objects
from
leaving
an
area


the
protocol
can
usually
only
be
initiated
by
someone
in
a
position
of
authority

^[1]
a
lockdown
can
also
be
used
to
protect
people
inside
a
facility
or
for
example
a
computing
system
from
a
threat
or
other
external
event


in
buildings
doors
leading
outside
are
usually
locked
so
that
no
person
may
enter
or
exit

types
[edit]
lockdowns
may
be
adopted
as
a
preventative
measure
or
in
response
to
a
crisis
as
an
emergency
measure


preventive
lockdown
[edit]
see
also
preventive
action
a
preventive
lockdown
is
a
preemptive
action
plan
implemented
to
address
an
unusual
scenario
or
a
weakness
in
system
to
preempt
any
danger
to
ensure
the
safety
and
security
of
people
organisation
and
system


the
focus
for
preventive
actions
is
to
avoid
dangers
and
risks
arising
from
the
nonconformity
to
the
normal
circumstances
but
also
commonly
includes
improvements
in
efficiency


preventive
lockdowns
are
preemptive
lockdowns
to
mitigate
risk


most
organisations
plan
for
the
emergency
lockdowns
but
fail
to
plan
for
other
situations
that
might
quickly
degrade
to
dangerous
levels


these
protocols
must
be
based
on
the
type
of
threat
and
should
be
kept
simple
and
short
for
quick
learning
and
implementation
and
flexible
enough
to
handle
several
scenarios


this
allows
administrators
more
options
to
choose
from
which
are
easier
to
use
in
various
scenarios


for
example
in
case
of
a
loud
scene
by
a
parent
or
an
unarmed
petty
thief
being
chased
by
the
police
through
the
school
playground
this
flexible
procedure
allows
school
administrators
the
flexibility
to
implement
a
more
limited
lockdown
while
teaching
in
school
continues
thus
eliminating
need
for
complete
emergency
lockdown
disruption
and
delays
in
resumption
of
teaching
etc


the
consequences
of
not
having
procedures
to
implement
such
lockdowns
is
that
the
situation
might
quickly
escalate
where
there
could
be
loss
of
human
lives

^[2]
emergency
lockdown
[edit]
see
also
emergency
procedure
emergency
lockdowns
are
implemented
when
there
is
imminent
threat
to
the
lives
or
risk
of
injury
to
humans
for
example
a
school
s
emergency
lockdown
procedures
must
be
kept
short
and
simple
to
make
them
easier
to
use
under
real
life
crisis
conditions


simple
procedures
can
be
easily
taught
with
periodic
lockdown
drills
instead
of
lengthy
training

^[2]
purposes
[edit]
both
preventative
and
emergency
lockdowns
can
be
adopted
for
similar
goals


they
may
be
use
for
security
purposes
to
reduce
the
number
of
people
on
the
street
to
allow
police
to
conduct
rescue
missions
after
natural
disasters


they
may
be
used
in
public
health
emergencies
such
as
ebola
and
covid
19
to
prevent
air
borne
diseases
from
spreading
and
they
may
be
used
as
counterinsurgency
measures
to
prevent
local
populations
mixing
with
insurgents
so
that
governments
can
conduct
military
missions
against
the
insurgents

^[3]
they
may
also
be
used
in
police
emergencies
as
in
school
shootings
or
hostage
situations

lockdown
procedures
vary
by
site
and
country


generally
a
lockdown
means
that
interior
and
exterior
doors
are
locked
and
all
students
and
staff
must
remain
in
their
location
from
the
time
the
lockdown
is
announced


in
some
locations
windows
are
covered
and
students
stand
at
the
back
of
the
classroom
or
away
from
windows


since
the
columbine
shooting
in
1999
and
the
september
11
2001
attacks
lockdown
procedures
in
schools
have
been
changing


some
schools
direct
teachers
to
continue
with
standard
procedures
while
remaining
quiet
while
some
recommend
an
active
approach
against
threats

^[17]
prisons
[edit]
in
prisons
the
term
lockdown
can
be
defined
as
a
course
of
action
to
control
the
movement
of
inmates


confining
all
prisoners
except
workers
to
their
cells
until
the
end
of
the
day
is
an
example
of
a
"lockdown
period"
in
a
corrections
schedule

^[citation
needed]
however
a
"full
lockdown"
is
used
when
all
prisoners
are
locked
in
their
cells
to
prevent
prison
riots
or
unrest
from
spreading
or
during
an
emergency

^[19]^[20]
occasions

lean
manufacturing
process
[edit]
in
manufacturing
the
term
lockdown
event
refers
to
a
continuous
improvement
initiative
in
which
manufacturing
in
a
specific
area
typically
a
cell
or
specific
piece
of
machinery
is
halted
in
order
to
contain
and
determine
what
are
the
issues
that
are
preventing
the
manufacture
of
goods
from
meeting
quality
specifications


during
the
lockdown
event
a
multi
disciplinary
team
reviews
the
specific
area
s
manufacturing
processes
tooling
and
machine
condition
to
find
the
root
cause
s
of
the
problem
s



once
changes
to
the
process
or
machine
repairs
that
may
include
adjustments
or
replacement
are
effected
a
sample
run
is
initiated
and
evaluated


if
the
results
of
the
validation
are
within
the
required
specifications
the
area
lockdown
is
lifted
and

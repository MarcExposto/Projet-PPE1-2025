strategies
for
managing
lockdown
reading
time
3
min
coping
with
lockdown
means
adapting
daily
life
to
these
new
circumstances


this
has
a
direct
impact
on
different
emotional
aspects
restructuring
and
adapting
new
spaces
and
suddenly
absorbing
new
situations
that
are
difficult
to
manage
amongst
others


professionals
recommend
a
series
of
tips
to
help
manage
this
situation
as
well
as
possible


emotional
aspects
when
it
comes
to
thoughts
caused
by
this
new
situation
and
the
information
generated
by
it
you
are
advised
to
woman
accept
the
situation
in
order
to
maintain
a
good
state
of
mind
and
to
be
calmer


person
with
a
questioner
indicating
cognitive
impairment
remember
the
reasons
behind
the
lockdown


person
with
crossed
out
tv
radio
and
mobile
phone
avoid
excessive
consumption
of
information


evaluate
it
and
contrast
it


a
person
who
asks
another
person
to
repeat
what
he
or
she
has
said
avoid
constantly
talking
about
covid
19


emotions
that
are
not
generally
recurrent
such
as
fear
uncertainty
or
frustration
and
that
may
now
arise
more
often
should
be
accepted
as
a
normal
response
to
an
abnormal
situation


in
this
sense
it
is
advisable
to
support
the
people
around
you
and
stay
in
regular
contact


behavioural
aspects
fear
is
one
of
the
emotions
that
runs
highest
when
experiencing
any
situation
of
crisis
such
as
covid
19


this
causes
behaviour
to
be
impulsive
instead
of
rational
meaning
it
is
important
to
follow
a
series
of
recommendations
in
order
to
both
recognise
and
accept
the
emotions
as
well
as
to
establish
routines
that
are
as
similar
to
normal
life
as
possible


well
adapted
building
or
house
follow
the
established
safety
measures


a
person
taking
a
shower
maintain
healthy
habits
in

out
different
activities
try

maintain
the
greatest
number
of
basic
routines


person
doing
yoga
do
enjoyable
and
relaxing
activities
that
don
t
require
going
anywhere


working
remotely
lockdown
has
meant
many
people
have
to
work
from
home
and
must
dedicate
a
space
in
their
house
to
this


as
far
as
is
possible
professionals
recommend
a
living
room
with
sofa
table
and
computer

up
a
space

possible
conditions
in
terms
of

interruptions


losing
important
people
an
exceptional
situation
has
arisen
in
the
context
of
covid
19


we
are
not
able
to
accompany
family
members
or
other
important
people
in
the
last
moments
of
their
lives
say
goodbye
or
be
at
the
side
of
those
who
need
support
at
this
time


for
this
reason
you
are
advised
to
carry
out
simple
actions
to
symbolise
a
goodbye


if
you
need
help
to
support
you
through
this
situation
you
are
recommended
person

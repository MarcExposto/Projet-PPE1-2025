leaders
from

asking
them
to
share
their
answer
to
the
following
the
question
life
in
2025


there
have
been
significant
debates
since
the
emergence
of
covid
19
about
its
potential
impact
on
global
society


much
of
the
conversation
has
centered
on
the
transformation
of
people
s
social
interactions
their
physical
and
mental
health
economic
and
social
divisions
the
nature
of
work
and
jobs
local
national
and
global
politics
climate
change
and
the
globalization
of
goods
and
services


of
course
the
evolution
of
people
and
technology
could
play
a
major
role
across
some
aspects
of
the
`new
normal
in
the
years
to
come


what
do
you
envision
the
`new
normal
for
digital
life
will
be
in
2025


consider
the
changes
that
are
being
set
in
motion
by
the
covid
19
outbreak
and
the
way
societies
are
responding


do
you
predict
these
changes
will
lead
to
life
in
2025
that
is
mostly
better
for
most
people
mostly
worse
for
most
people
or
not
much
different
for
most
people
than
life
was
at
the
time
the
pandemic
began


915
respondents
answered
the
question
*
about
47%
said
life
will
be
mostly
worse
for
most
people
in
2025
than
when
the
pandemic
began


*
about
39%
said
life
will
be
mostly
better
for
most
people
in
2025


*
about
14%
said
life
in
2025
will
not
be
much
different
for
most
people
than
before
the
pandemic
began
in
2020


they
were
asked
to
elaborate
on
their
choice
with
these
prompts
if
you
expect
change
what
do
you
think
the
`new
normal
will
be
for
the
average
person
in
2025


what
will
have
changed
most


what
will
not
change
much
at
all


we
are
particularly
interested
in
what
you
think
will
happen
to
the
way
people
use
and
think
about
technology


please
describe
what
you
think
the
`new
normal
will
look
like
with
regard
to
the
role
of
digital
technologies
in
individuals
personal
and
professional
lives
their
daily
routines
their
well
being
their
privacy
their
employment
and
economic
security


what
hopes
do
you
have
for
tech
related
changes
that
might
make
life
better
in
coming
years


what
worries
you
about
the
role
of
technology
and
technology
companies
in
individuals
lives
in
2025


the
full
report
with

the
key

tele
everything
is
embraced
the
broad
adoption
of
"remote"
processes
tele
work
tele
medicine
virtual
schooling
e
commerce
and
more
is
growing


in
2025
there
will
be
more
people
working
from
home
more
virtual
social
and
entertainment
interactions
fewer
forays
in
public
than
has
been
in
the
case
in
recent
years


humans
yearning
for
convenience
and
safety
fuels
reliance
on
digital
tools
the
pandemic
has
rearranged
incentives
so
that
consumers
will
be
more
willing
to
seek
out
smart
gadgets
apps
and
systems


this
will
speed
up
adoption
of
new
education
and
learning
platforms
rearrange
work
patterns
and
workplaces
change
family
life
and
upend
living
arrangements
and
community
structures


the
best
and
worst
of
human
nature
are
amplified
the
crisis
is
enhancing
digital
interconnectedness
that
engenders
empathy
better
awareness
of
the
ills
facing
humanity
and
positive
public
action


on
the
flip
side
some
individuals
cities
and
nation
states
will
become
more
insular
and
competitive
as
survival
mode
kicks
in


xenophobia
bigotry
and
closed
communities
will
also
increase


*
worries
for
2025
inequality
and
injustice
are
magnified
the
pandemic
and
quick
pivot
to
the
use
of
digitally
driven
systems
will
widen
divides
and
expand
the
ranks
of
the
unemployed
uninsured
and
disenfranchised


the
power
imbalances
between
the
advantaged
and
disadvantaged
are
being
magnified
by
digital
systems
overseen
by
behemoth
firms
as
they
exploit
big
data
and
algorithmic
decision
making
that
are
often
biased


more
people
will
be
pushed
into
a
precarious
existence
that
lacks
predictability
economic
security
and
wellness


as
risk
grows
security
must
also
privacy
falls
and
authoritarianism
rises
the
health
crisis
spawned
by
the
pandemic
and
broader
dependence
people
have
on
the
internet
heighten
threats
of
criminal
activity
hacks
and
other
attacks


optimized
security
solutions
may
further
reduce
individuals
privacy
and
civil
liberties


they
are
likely
to
expand
mass
surveillance
as
authoritarian
states
will
use
this
as
an
opportunity
to
silence
dissent
and
abuse
citizens
civil
rights


threats
to
work
will
intensify
from
automation
artificial
intelligence
robotics
and
globalization
in
order
to
survive
businesses
are
reconfiguring
systems
and
processes
to
automate
as
many
aspects
as
possible


while
artificial
intelligence
ai
and
robotics
will
enhance
some
lives
they
will
damage
others
as
more
work
is
taken
over
by
machines


employers
may
outsource
labor
to
the
lowest
bidder
globally


employees
may
be
asked
to
work
for
far
less
they
may
have
to
shift
to
be
gig
and
contract
workers
supplying
their
own
equipment
and
they
may
be
surveilled
at
home
by
employers


misinformation
will
be
rampant
digital
propaganda
is
unstoppable
and
the
rapidly
expanding
weaponization
of
cloud
based
technologies
divides
the
public
deteriorates
social
cohesion
and
threatens
rational
deliberation
and
evidence
based
policymaking


people
s
mental
health
will
be
challenged
digital
life
was
already
high
stress
for
some
people
prior
to
the
required
social
isolation
brought
on
by
the
pandemic


the
shift
to
tele
everything
will
be
extensive
and
that
will
diminish
in
person
contact
and
constrict
tech
users
real
world
support
systems
and
their
social
connections


*
hopes
for
2025
social
justice
will
get
priority
the
reawakening
of
public
movements
for
social
justice
and
economic
equality
may
create
more
responsive
government
and
socio
political
systems
that
are
more
attuned
to
diversity
equity
and
inclusion


that
includes
focus
on
digital

being
will
prevail
over
profit
businesses
may
start
to
value
serving
the
greater
good
above
the
typical
goals
of

capitalism


this
could
produce
policies
to
fund
broader
safety
nets
such
as
universal
health
care
universal
basic
income
and
broadband
as
a
basic
utility


a

for

leaders
might
also
occur

the
respondent
selected
none
of
the
three
choices
but
did
write
a
response


some
people
chose
not
to
provide
a
written

some
of
the
following
are
the
longer
versions
of
responses
that
are
contained
in
shorter
form
in
one
or
more
places
the
survey
report


these
comments
were
collected
in
an
opt
in
invitation
to
more
than
10
000
people
that
asked
them
to
share
their
responses
to
a
web
based
questionnaire
in
july
2020


the
following
predictions
are
from
respondents
who
said
most
people
s
lives
will
be
mostly
worse
in
2025
than
they
were
prior
to
the
arrival
of
the
pandemic
a
telecommunications
and
internet
industry
economist
architect
and
consultant
with
over
25
years
of
experience
now
working
as
a
researcher
at
one
of
the
world
s
foremost
technological
universities
responded
"things
in
2025
will
be
mostly
worse
for
most
people
because
of
the
economic
downturn
associated
with
responding
to
the
crisis
which
was
aggravated
in
the
case
of
the
u

s


by
a
leadership
failure
that
has
made
covid
19
worse
and
consequently
made
the
associated
economic
downturn
worse


this
is
a
global
phenomenon
that
has
reversed
and
substantially
set
back
global
efforts
to
address
income
inequality
and
a
host
of
other
problems
that
we
were
not
addressing
adequately
in
any
case


the
impacts
of
covid
19
health
wise
and
economically
are
regressive
and
i
doubt
we
will
have
the
political
will
to
really
address
those
challenges
head
on


in
the
u

s


the
picture
is
likely
to
be
better
since
the
failure
in
leadership
we
have
experienced
under
trump
will
hopefully
be
reversed
and
a
number
of
other
issues
may
also
see
a
brighter
side
such
as
awareness
of
and
possible
partial
solutions
to
climate
change
and
preparation
for
the
next
covid
19
like
pandemic
which
had
been
anticipated
before
but
not
taken
seriously
our
preparedness
for
the
next
one
is
likely
to
be
better



through
all
of
this
the
role
of
digital
technologies
in
enabling
remote
social
and
economic
activity
has
been
critical
and
has
prevented
the
problem
from
being
even
worse


the
new
normal
will
include
much
greater
acceptance
of
remote
work
and
telecommuting
in
both
cases
things
that
were
happening
and
needed
to
happen
but
which
have
experienced
a
step
function
enhancement


this
will
provide
an
opportunity
to
address
climate
change
issues
and
possibly
encourage
better
commuting
practices


the
movement
away
from
urbanization
toward
suburbanization
and
the
adverse
impact
on
public
transport
systems
are
both
on
the
negative
side


i
think
we
will
see
a
step
increase
in
cybersecurity
threats
the
expansion
in
attack
surfaces
because
more
folks
are
online
is
a
sufficient
reason
for
that
and
the
concurrent
increase
in
risks
to
personal
liberty
of
surveillance
society


we
need
to
be
clear
on
what
we
want
in
our
society
but
stopping
it
is
unlikely
to
be
feasible
in
my
view


i
think
more
people
will
have
more
complicated
relationships
and
understanding
of
digital
technologies


our
dependency
and
social
fluency
with
using
it
will
be
greatly
advanced
e

g


everyone
now
knows
how
to
use
facebook
and
zoom
but
folks
will
not
wholly
appreciate
the
new
technologies
and
will
not
like
the
threats
to
privacy
and
cybersecurity
and
the
political
disruption
of
phenomena
like
`fake
news
which
are
greatly
and
inexorably
amplified
by
the
dark
side
of
social
media


in
giving
voice
to
all
and
in
enabling
the
viral
spread
of
that
voice
the
internet
and
digital
technologies
have
overridden
more
normal
social
and
economic
defense
mechanisms
against
the
destructive
power
of
fear
and
hatemongering
speech
it
is
too
attractive
as
a
consumption
good
for
people
to
simply
turn
away
and
too
powerful
as
a
mode
of
expression
to
expect
the
perpetrators
to
simply
disappear


unfortunately
there
are
no
silver
bullet
solutions


also
as
a
complementary
effect
the
boost
to
digitalization
will
accelerate
other
trends
although
the
adverse
macroeconomic
effects
provide
an
offsetting
dampening
effect
such
as
the
trend
towards
adoption
of
ai
and
other
automation
technologies
that
will
involve
a
lot
of
capital
substituting
for
labor
so
a
lot
of
disruption
in
employment
markets
that
will
not
be
limited
to
low
skilled
workers


lots
of
other
`white
collar
trades
will
be
ripe
for
offshoring
and
automation
like
lots
of
legal
work


in
the
short
medium
term
i
expect
this
to
have
significant
disruptive
effects
requiring
workers
across
the
economy
to
re
train
and
be
more
flexible
and
adaptive


the
over
hang
of
covid
19
related
debt
grotesquely
amplified
by
bad
fiscal
policies
since
2016
will
make
it
difficult
to
raise
the
funds
for
subsidy
programs
to
aging
populations
and
the
pension
fund
risk
is
significant
and
could
herald
a
global
economic
crisis
that
might
make
2008
look
like
child
s
play


strong
leadership
and
a
commitment
to
something
like
addressing
climate
change
and
rebuilding
our
infrastructure
and
economy
to
support
that
direction
might
offer
a
path
out
of
it
but
i
despair
of
that
sort
of
leadership
really
being
able
to
be
successful
in
the
u

s


or
globally

"
hopes
"1
telecommuting
it
expands
accessibility
enables
flexibility
and
reduces
greenhouse
gases


2
smart
especially
smart
energy
systems
these
are
not
feasible
without
icts
and
digitalization
is
a
necessary
but
not
sufficient
solution
to
address


there
is
huge
potential
for
ict
augmented
productivity
and
efficiency
improvements
across
all
sectors
from
healthcare
to
finance
to
manufacturing
to
education


of
course
realizing
these
benefits
is
not
automatic
requires
co
evolution
of
`analog
policies
and
will
need
to
confront
adverse
trends
that
digitalization
can
also
bring
so
realizing
this
potential
will
not
be
easy

"
worries
"threats
to
income
inequality
privacy
and
security
and
fragmentation
and
disruption
of
sound
political
discourse


the
world
is
a
more
complex
place
and
requires
more
multidisciplinary/cross
disciplinary
and
cross
cultural
engagement
to
address
challenges
but
putting
those
together
is
hard


digital
technology
is
essential
to
support
the
multistakeholder
types
of
governance
solutions
we
need
but
it
is
also
very
effective
in
implementing
authoritarian
solutions
and
in
mobilizing
ignorance
and
mob
rule


it
will
be
a
battle
to
see
whether
our
better
halves
can
succeed

a
research
professor
of
international

said
"surveillance

equivalent

for
a
model

consider
the

in

the

the
manager
of
a
project
focused
on
enhancing
digital
life
said
"the
nature
of
the
`new
normal
will
likely
depend
very
much
on
socio
economic
status
geographic
location
and
nature
of
employment
prior
to
the
pandemic


i
therefore
don
t
think
it
makes
much
sense
to
discuss
what
it
will
mean
for
the
`average
person
unless
a
working
definition
of
that
term
is
in
place


except
for
the
independently
wealthy
high
status
so
called
`white
collar
knowledge
workers
whose
day
to
day
lives
mostly
dealt
with
information
flows
i
think
that
for
the
most
part
people
will
be
worse
off
in
the
united
states
and
other
countries
that
have
failed
to
handle
their
response
to
the
pandemic
well


there
s
simply
no
way
that
the
crushing
unemployment
racially
disparate
death
rates
economic
losses
and
educational
deterioration
in
these
nations
will
have
all
been
erased
in
four
or
five
years


barring
major
government
intervention
i
suspect
very
high
consistent
unemployment
at
capacity
healthcare
systems
and
dramatically
increased
social
stratification


i
predict
a
greater
economic
and
political
role
globally
for
countries
that
weather
the
pandemic
well
such
as
vietnam
taiwan
and
new
zealand


specifically
with
respect
to
digital
technology
for
those
with
adequate
bandwidth
as
of
now
quite
unevenly
distributed
remote
participation
in
work
and
in
general
will
be
much
more
common
perhaps
even
normative


there
will
be
less
business
travel
as
companies
will
have
been
forced
to
either
adapt
to
its
loss
or
will
have
realized
it
is
not
as
important
as
previously
thought


work
from
home
will
be
commonplace
for
those
who
can
do
so


i
hope
but
am
less
sanguine
that
necessarily
in
person
work
will
be
better
compensated
in
general


i
think
daily
routines
will
be
more
`bubbled
as
people
are
more
generally
mindful
of
their
contacts
and
exposure
and
there
will
be
a
greater
reliance
in
general
on
remote
connection
over
face
to
face
which
will
be
reserved
for
close
friends
and
family


i
expect
a
diversification
of
employment
to
remote
modalities
as
people
will
want
to
have
a
revenue
stream
that
is
less
contingent
on
physical
presence
which
will
lead
to
stratification
since
not
everyone
will
have
time
education
or
bandwidth
to
develop
alternate
jobs


being
able
to
`go
digital
will
be
much
more
critical
and
those
whose
jobs
must
be
in
person
will
be
far
more
vulnerable


privacy
could
go
two
ways


it
could
continue
to
erode
as
more
and
more
move
to
online
and
are
therefore
surveilled
or
the
increasing
awareness
of
privacy
vulnerabilities
could
trigger
a
backlash
and
as
people
move
or
are
driven
online
they
may
demand
great
privacy
and
regulation
of
online
data
etc

"
hopes
"the
currently
burgeoning
movement
to
ban
and
control
facial
recognition
technologies
leaves
me
with
some
hope
that
more
regulation
of
easily
misused
technologies
may
be
possible


i
hope
that
the
move
of
more
work
and
meetings
etc


online
may
make
living
in
a
particular
place
less
relevant
and
therefore
will
have
a
flattening
effect
on
home
prices
in
parts
of
the
country

it
is
nearly
impossible
to
live

realizations

be
in
the
sweep
of

s

election
and
things
are
already
getting
pretty
ugly


this

seems
to
have
made
mistrust

even
more
of
a
problem
than
it
has
been
in
the

element

trust

not

we
have
to
include
a
decline
in
trust
of
social

platforms

the
fact
that
more
and
more
of
the

so
the

imagine

my
most
hopeful
moments
i
wish
for
the
development

algorithmic
systems

are
capable

and
worthy
of

trust
we
would
have
to
place
in
them
for
us
to
rely
upon
the
advice
recommendations
warnings
and
guidance
about
the
choices
we
face
in
the
short
and
long
terms


these
trusted
systems
would
course
have
to
be
`smart
but
they
would
also
have
to
have
developed
a
capacity
for
understanding
the
moral
and
ethical
systems
of
value
that
each
of
us
have
developed
or
are
developing
for
ourselves


these
systems
would
have
to
be
strictly
constrained
against
sharing
information
and
inferences
that
they
have
developed
in
order
to
serve
our
interests
with
others
that
we
have
not
specifically
granted
access
to
information
and
inferences
about
us
our
status
our
goals
our
strengths
our
weaknesses

again
i
need
to
be
clear
here


we
will
continue
to
be
assessed
by
other
algorithmic
systems

i
am
only
referring
to
those
systems

which
we
establish
a
relationship
specifically
for
the
purpose

gaining
insights/guidance
about
how
we
should
proceed
toward
the
future


for
me
the
ideal
system
would
be
much
like
a
trusted
friend
one
that
is
able
to
challenge
me
about
tentative
decisions/actions
based
not
only
with
regard
to
my
hopes
dreams
and
values
but
also
in
terms
of
the
levels
of
knowledge
and
ignorance
i
might
have
about
the
benefits
and
risks
i
need
to
consider
in
pursuing
those
options

it
is
a

five

employers
will
monitor
even
white

people
will
also
discover
they
can

may
find

"my
hope
is
that
we
build
an
immune
system
for
the
planet
now


while
the
pitches
to
darpa
in
2013
and
2016
were
not
funded
at
the
time
such
a
solution
remains
viable

more
possible
to
start
in
the
next
two
to
five
years
given
advances
in

the
premise
of

centers
around
the
recognition
that
per
the
2001
anthrax
events
sars
h1n1
the
biggest
threat
of
biological
agents
is
the
protracted
time
window
it
takes
to
characterize
develop
treatment
and
perform
remediation


we
certainly
are
seeing
this
again

the

19
pandemic


exponentially
reducing
the
time
it
takes
to
mitigate
a
biothreat
agent

save

to
do
this
we
need
to
automate

developing

take
humans

"
worries
"back
in
2013
and
again
in
2016
a
proposal
informed
by
the
anthrax
events
of
2001
west
nile
virus
in
2002
and
both
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
sars
and
an
outbreak
of
monkeypox
in
the
united
states
in
2003
was
shared
with
the
defense
advanced
research
projects
agency
darpa



the
proposal
at
the
time
was
something
seen
as
a
safeguard
against
a
`low
probability
high
consequence
event
a
natural
or
human
caused
pandemic


the
solution
was
a
series
of
proposals
centered
around
the
concept
of
building
an
`immune
system
for
the
planet
that
could
detect
a
novel
pathogen
in
the
air
water
or
soil
of
the
earth
and
rapidly
sequence
its
dna
or
rna


once
sequenced
high
performance
computers
would
strive
to
identify
both
the
three
dimensional
protein
surfaces
of
either
the
virus
or
bacteria
and
then
search
through
an
index
of
known
molecular
therapies
that
might
be
able
to
neutralize
the
pathogen


at
a
minimum
such
an
immune
system
for
the
planet
would
overcome
the
limits
of
waiting
for
nation
states
themselves
to
alert
the
international
community
of
outbreaks
within
their
borders


a
second
reason
also
was
associated
with
this
proposal
namely
exponential
changes
in
technology
and
create
pressures
for
representative
democracies
republics
and
other
forms
of
deliberative
governments
to
keep
up
both
at
home
and
abroad


in
an
era
in
which
precision
medicine
will
be
possible
so
too
will
be
precision
poison
tailored
and
at
a
distance


as
proposed
both
in
2013
and
again
in
2016
this
will
become
a
national
security
issue
if
we
don
t
figure
out
how
to
better
use
technology
to
do
the
work
of
deliberative
governance
at
the
necessary
speed
needed
to
keep
up
with
threats
associated
with
pandemics

"
an
internet
pioneer
and
principal
architect
at
a
major
technology
company
said
"by
2025
the
economy
will
be
on
an
upward
trend
but
unemployment
and
gdp
will
still
not
have
returned
to
the
levels
of
february
2020


in
particular
the
banking
arts
retail
real
estate
and
travel/hospitality
sectors
will
not
have
recovered
completely
due
to
the
high
level
of
retail
bankruptcies
which
in
turn
led
to
a
real
estate
downturn
and
high
levels
of
loan
defaults
in
the
banking
sector


also
virus
vaccines
will
prove
only
partially
effective
with
new
strains
continually
evolving


so
pandemics
will
become
an
ongoing
problem
that
will
result
in
lower
levels
of
international
travel
and
trade


with
so
many
retail
businesses
shuttered
the
levels
of
online
purchases
will
have
soared


also
many
arts
groups
theatres
museums
will
have
been
forced
to
either
adapt
to
the
online
world
or
to
close


this
will
lead
to
virtual
museum
tours
and
exhibits
theatre
groups
with
seasons
produced
online
and
many
television
programs
produced
at
home


similarly
with
movie
theatres
having
declared
bankruptcy
new
movies
will
largely
be
released
on
streaming
services


remote
work
will
have
become
the
`new
normal
leading
many
companies
to
reduce
their
real
estate
footprint


many
educational
institutions
will
have
moved
to
online
learning
as
their
principle
means
of
instruction


with
`work
from
home
as
the
new
normal
we
will
see
a
mass
migration
away
from
expensive
west
coast
cities
like
san
francisco
san
jose
seattle
and
los
angeles


some
will
move
to
nearby
less
expensive
areas
like
sacramento
gilroy
north
bend
or
palmdale


others
will
leave
those
states
for
nevada
arizona
new
mexico
or
oregon

"
hopes
"much
of
the
tech
innovation
occurring
today
is
driven
by
customers
adapting
to
the
`new
normal
rather
than
from
product
developers


however
in
the
years
to
come
we
will
see
products
adapting
to
those
new
uses
of
the
technology


as
an
example
educational
institutions
have
rapidly
moved
to
online
learning
but
the
results
have
been
uninspiring
because
the
products
that
are
being
used
were
not
designed
for
online
learning
and
the
curriculum
has
not
been
honed
for
it


by
2025
many
of
the
kinks
will
have
been
worked
out
and
new
products
designed
from
the
ground
up
for
education
will
have
taken
root
delivering
much
better
results


similarly
by
2025
we
will
see
products
designed
to
help
produce
tv
shows
from
home
that
will
yield
results
virtually
indistinguishable
from
shows
produced
in
the
studio


also
movie
production
will
have
developed
distribution
mechanisms
that
allow
new
movies
to
be
as
profitable
via
streaming
production
as
they
were
being
distributed
in
movie
theatres


similarly
musicians
will
have
mastered
production
and
distribution
of
online
concerts
so
as
to
enable
them
to
continue
performing
without
having
to
do
shows
in
large
arenas
that
will
have
remained
shuttered


exercise
programs
will
have
moved
online
after
most
gym
chains

will
be
able

their

"
worries
"with
work
and
play
having
migrated
online
the
amount
of
personal
data
available
in
the
online
world
will
skyrocket


this
will
create
challenges
to
privacy
with
personal
information
increasingly
available
for
sale
and
exploitation


despite
companies
playing
lip
service
to
reducing
discrimination
the
focus
on
online
interaction
will
be
shown
to
increase
implicit
bias


overall
income
inequality
will
soar
and
unemployment
rates
will
remain
steadily
high
because
jobs
in
retail
travel/hospitality
will
have
ceased
to
exist
and
tech
companies
will
have
made
little
progress
on
diversity

based
in
berkeley
california
wrote
"some
people
will
be
better
off
because
of
more
flexible
work
patterns
reduced

but
a
lot
of
other
jobs
will
be
harder
to
find


for
example
it
appears
that
many
restaurants
will
never
reopen

will
eliminate
a
lot
of
those
jobs

of
that
should
be
hitting
hard
in
five
years


i
doubt
that
air
travel
will
recover
even
in
five
years
putting
a
lot
of
people
in
that
industry
out
of
jobs
which
will
in
turn
result
in
reduced
factory
work
for
people
in
the
supply
chains
of
that
industry


so
there
will
be
some
winners
and
some
losers
but
i
think
the
losers
will
outnumber
the
winners

"
hopes
"lots
of
places
have
discovered
that
sometimes
online
work

meetings

work

effectively


this
will
mean
less
commuting
lower
pollution
and
for
a
lot
of
people
less
stress

"
worries
"working
from
home
is
a
double
edged
sword


it
s
harder
to
make
social
connections
with
people
online
which
will
reduce
teamwork
and
loyalty
probably
resulting
in
higher
turnover
and
ultimately
a
less
committed
society
in
general

"
the
chairman
of
an
investment
and
strategic
advisory
firm
observed
"the
coronavirus
has
some
idiosyncratically
specific
effects
but
is
largely
accelerating
and/or
exacerbating
trends
that
were
already
underway
relevantly
to
this
question
the
consolidation
of
many
sectors
of
the
commercial
and
economic
landscape
and
the
growing
inequality
that
will
accompany
that


digital
technologies
will
surely
be
more
centrally
important
in
most
lives
than
they
were
before
the
pandemic
even
if
less
than
at
the
height
of
lockdowns
with
the
resulting
increase
in
the
subjection
of
americans
to
surveillance
capitalism


a
new
administration
nationally
and
in
several
currently
red
states
could
set
the
stage
for
regulatory
and
fiscal
moves
that
might
soften
even
redirect
these
forces
but
even
if
we
shake
free
of
regulatory
capture
we
re
likely
to
find
ourselves
hamstrung
by
fiscal
constraints
created
by
the
economic
impact
of

that
will
be
bad
at
the
national
level
worse
at

worst
at

is
difficult

the

has
strained

not
responded
well


it
will
be
harder
to
make
advances
even
using

privacy
in

will
be
under
threat
as
intrusive
technologies
are
`justified
on
the
basis

"
hopes
"the
main
benefit
has
been
the
realisation
that
people
do
not
need
to
work
in
offices
they
can
do
much
at
home


this
will
potentially
allow
them
to
save
time
by
not

and
they
can
spend
more
time
with
their
families

"
worries
"see
previous
comment
about

"
a
journalism
professor
emeritus
said
"the
new
normal
will
be
a
society
more
paranoid
about
casual
human
interactions
handshakes
hugs
and
sitting
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
strangers
in
theaters
restaurants
and
airplanes


shopping
malls
cruise
lines
hotels
and
international
travel
industries
will
shrivel
with
the
survivors
becoming
less
affordable
to
the
average
person


online
banking
online
shopping
streaming
entertainment
telemedicine
videoconferencing
virtual
work
teams
and
working
from
home
would
likely
emerge
as
new
normals
at
least
in
western
societies


these
changes
may
have
dramatic
impacts
on
transportation
and
urban
life
in
particular


and
they
could
result
in
fewer
people
finding
it
necessary
to
live
in
central
cities
or
to
commute
long
distances
into
central
cities
to

impacts
are
going
to
interact
with
the
covid
19
disruptions

our
digital
evolution
in
ways
we
can
t
fully
anticipate

it
would
be
naive
not
to
expect
more
coastal
flooding
more
droughts

shortages
water
shortages
global
instabilities/migrations
and
extreme
weather
events


by
2025
we
ll
be
wrestling
with
how
to
best
redefine
how
we
live

play
far
more
seriously

urgently
than
we
seem
to
be
doing
right
now


and
we
ll
still
have
the
headwind
of
how
to
deal
with
the
economic
impacts
and
with
resistance
by
those
who
want
to
hang
on
to
the
status
quo


how
or
if
we
re
able
to
deploy
new
digital
technologies
and
ai
to
create
opportunities
will
be
key
to
determining
if
we
have
a
viable
future
or
not


our
collective
interface
with
the
world
will
come
largely
via
mediation
rather
than
human
interaction


and
ai
will
play
an
ever
larger
role
in
that
mediation
as
it
finds
applications
for
routine
health
screenings
and
diagnosis
finance
sales
training
audits
quality
control
r&d
education
and
of
course
warehousing
transportation
and
manufacturing


and
with
this
ubiquitous
reliance
we
will
be
at
even
greater
risk
of
cyber
security
threats
job
losses
for
millions
and
core
infrastructure
collapse
due
to
geomagnetic
storms
for
example


yet
what
seems
like
an
inevitable
march
toward
the
deployment
of
ai
will
run
headlong
into
an
educational
system
not
able
to
respond
fast
enough
for
populations
that
need
meaningful
work
or
to
the
social
and
political
disruptions
resulting
from
our
health
safety
concerns
and
the
environmental
crisis
due
to
climate
change


not
to
mention
political
instabilities

there
have
always
been

already
we

a
consequence
of

and
human

desperate

the

not
factored
into
this
are
the

i
m
hoping
that

those

corporate

an

commented
"increased

i
think
that
the
way

view

will
change
the
most
and
there
will
also
be
a

will
be

and
we

by

many
of

will
be

the

will
shed
thousands

"
a
post
doctoral
researcher
studying
the
relationship
between
governance
public
policy
and
computer
systems
observed
"the
pandemic
entrenches
existing
social
structures
and
the
monopolization
of
the
market
economy
while
also
revealing
these
phenomena
and
exacerbating
the
precarity
of
modern
american
society


it
is
possible
that
the
pandemic
will
serve
as
a
catalyst
for
making
changes
necessary
to
improving
life
but
by
2025
it
seems
unlikely
that
so
many
changes
will
have
taken
place


still
there
are
hopeful
signs
in
the
protest
movement
and
the
rapid
shifting
of
overton
windows
on
many
topics
so
one
must
hold
out
hope
even
while
being
realistic


from
a
technology
perspective
the
rapid
shift
to
work
online
has
made
the
powerful
players
more
powerful
and
entrenched


much
of
technology
usage
depends
on
people
s
understanding
of
how
to
use
it
and
we
have
jumped
fully
into
the
deep
end
of
the
pool
well
before
having
learned
how
to
swim


for
example
life
for
many
people
now
revolves
around
online
conferencing
but
how
to
integrate
such
conferencing
into
organizations
is
not
widely
understood


similarly
the
economic
conditions
resulting
from
the
pandemic
limit
the
capacity
for
small
business
to
fight
established
business
and
also
create
new
economic
imperatives
for
the
adoption
of
existing
technologies


together
these
forces
entrench
established
players
and
hurt
new
entrants
and
competitors


there
is
an
opportunity
to
counter
this
with
policy
though
it
is
being
squandered

"
hopes
"it
is
my
hope
that
we
can
find
ways
to
better
integrate
technologies
organizations
and
policies
to
realize
the
long
held
dream
that
it
is
possible
to
use
information
technologies
to
improve
communication
among
people
while
enabling
control
over
personal
information


this
would
enable
the
promise
of
information
technologies
while
limiting
and
controlling
the
risks


it
is
not
at
all
clear
that
the
market
supports
such
constructs
however
but
i
have
to
hope
it
does
and
to
attempt
research
and
development
in
the
direction
of
that
goal

"
worries
"i
worry
that
companies
will
dictate
the
metes
and
bounds

computing
access
and

control
robbing
individuals
of

of
their
bottom
lines


i
worry
as
well
about
the
abuse
of
technologies
like
social
networks
to
further
disintegrate
social
fabrics
in
liberal
democracies
especially
because
i
don
t
know
how
to
push
back
against
it

an
internet
policy
researcher
said
"more
people
use

use
technology
after
being
`forced
to

the
lockdown


not
all
but
more
employers
will
see
the
benefits
of
remote
working
cost
wise
which
may
reflect
both
as
positive
and
negative
on
employees
as
employers
expect
more
availability
from
workers
if
they
are
not
in
the
office
working
at
night
weekends
holidays

this
will
reflect
badly
on
work
life
balances


i
expect
the
new
normal
to
also
increase
number
of
workers
in
the
gig
economy
which
means
more
job
opportunities
but
less
benefits
and
social
security
for
workers


slowly
more
companies
and
individuals
will
understand
the
vital
importance
of
cybersecurity
as
cybercrime
rises
with
increased
digitalisation

"
hopes
"telehealth
and
remote
learning
will
gradually
improve
with
more
widespread
use


this
can
allow
more
disadvantaged/remote

access
to
previously
unavailable

the
digital
divide
is
addressed
during
the
process


"

increased
importance

prevalence
of

tech
companies

the
lack
of

transparency
of

company
policy
and
practices
can
result
in
communities
even
governments
increased
dependence
on
these

some
of
which

are

global
monopolies



the
fact
that
the
managers
and
employees
of
these
companies
who
decide
on
practices
and
policies
are
not
elected
yet
they
have
such
great
impact
on
how
more
than
half
of

"
the
principal
architect
for
a

company
noted
"many
people
will
be
unemployed


right

governments
are
removing
the
safety
nets
leaving

to
fend
for
themselves
when
they
cannot


tech
workers

information
workers
will
be
able
to
remain
employed

work
from
home
creating
a
divide
between

those
who
cannot


tech

internet
will
not
help

so
the

initially
be

much
worse

social

predicted
"the

the
ever
increasing
widening
gulf
between

within

increasing
reliance
on
digital
technologies
to
conduct
even
more
of
the

that
used
to
be
community
or
face

this
will
result
in
increasing

commercial
actors

in
the
field

my
area
of
expertise
schooling
will
become
ever
more
a
process

individualised
competition
for

dwindling
supply

opportunities
unless
significant
steps
can
be
taken
to
reassert
the
social
and
civic
value

democratic
societies


the
increasing
reliance
on
personalised
learning
at
the
expense

other
kinds

activities

become
evident


whilst
this
could
lead
to
an
increase
in
different
ways

classrooms

learning

the
pandemic
seems
to
have
only
brought
into
the
open
that

a
fundamental
role

a

i
hope
that

i

virtually

at

in

"the

panic
seems
to
be
further
driving
ahead
part
of
a
larger
cultural
move
towards

more
emotion

much
less
thoughtful
discourse


the
`karen

and
other
public
shaming
of
people
by
claiming
extreme
results
from
mundane
`failures
of
etiquette
escalating
`not
wearing
a
mask
to
`you

leading
to
an
acceptance
of
radicalization
and
these
faulty
chains
of
logic
in
more
areas
or
perhaps
it
is
just
becoming
more
obvious
that
this
is
happening



there
is
also
a
much
greater
acceptance
of
authority
even
when
the
authority
approves
of
mob
actions
which
is
from
the
outside
a
move
against
the
authority
itself


maybe
people
should
wonder
if
mobs
against
authority
which
are
approved
by
those
authorities
are
actually
against
the
authority


we
are
moving
into
a
world
where
a
new
elite
the
3%
of
people
shouting
on
twitter
and
other
services
control
the
direction
and
agenda
of
nations


since
twitter
is
primarily
concerned
with
engagement
they
float
emotional
content
to
the
top
driving
the
move
towards
viewing
the
world
from
within
a
purely
emotional
bubble


it
s
a
very
worrying
development


post
covid
19
and
riots
people
will
be
constantly
worried
about
losing
their
livelihoods
and
families
which
is
going
to
have
a
major
impact
of
family
and
business
formation

are
going

trust

i
can
only
hope
people
view
technology
in

anything
based
on
neurodigital

such
as
social

with
a
great
deal
more
suspicion


i
fear
however
that
we

far
too
dependent
on
these
technologies
to
make
any
real
changes
here
even
though
we
may
be
starting
to
mistrust
them


people
will
continue
to
use
these
technologies
en

with
little
thought
for
what
that
use
does


one
interesting
trend
i
m
starting
to
see
is
that
some
younger
folks
have
stopped
putting
their

online
becoming
lurkers
rather
than
performers
all
the

this
is
a
healthy
change

further
erode

personal
life
is
commingled

will
there
be
ways

erect
firewalls
between
the
two

there
are
the
security
challenges
that
come
with
this
new
digital

in
pushing
a

remote

threat
surface
grows
exponentially
as

merge


adding
complexity

generally
led

not
more

data
protection


they
ultimately
demurred
on
this
question
reasoning
that
the
private
sector
would
know
better
than
the
government
how
to
respond
to
these
issues
as
they
arise


privacy
on
the
internet
has
largely
been
self
regulated
in
this
way
for
the
better
part
of
three
decades
and
it
s
only
become
more
obvious
over
time
that
letting
this
remain
an
ungoverned
territory
is
not
wise


yet
the
future
is
likely
to
bring
with
it
ways
to
interact
with
each
other
online
and
thus
more
intermediaries
and
opportunities
for
companies
to
be
in
positions
with
access
to
individuals
digital
existences


most
concerning
is
that
we
don
t
have
great
solutions
for
how
we
should
govern
privacy
despite
having
the
benefit
of
several
decades
worth
of
debate
about
it


laws
like
europe
s
gdpr
provide
at
best
an
incremental
improvement
over
the
status
quo
while
competitively
disadvantaging
small
and
mid
size
companies

the

because
of
the

with

leave

an
increased
sense
of
overlord

powerlessness


high
expectations

privacy
is
being
sacrificed
in
the
name
of

which
so
far
have
not
delivered

i

real

choice
point
a
point
in
time
where
anything
is
possible
and
we
can
reconfigure
based
on
where
we
want
to
go


the
latter
part
of
the
question
being
`given
how
societies
are
responding
looking
here
in
the
u

s


we
are
at
a
boiling
point
of
polarization


the
level
of
intensity
is
one
we
haven
t
experienced
and
nefarious
actors
are
taking
advantage
both
financially
and
with
power
grabs


so
a
lot
of
my
answer
sways
in
the
immediate
moment


in
november
we
will
have
an
election


the
outcome
of
the
election
will
shift
a
lot


in
the
best
outcome
we
will
reconfigure
our
food
energy
and
economic
systems
to
allow
for
more
decentralized
and
self
reliant
systems


the
potential
to
transition
jobs
is
massive
and
i
believe
the
divestment
of
$30
40
trillion
is
going
to
drive
the
outcomes
of
economic
shifts
towards
esg
investments
which
shall
drive
business


so
this
pressure
if
offsetting
the
dark
abyss
we
have
fallen
into


the
key
is
can
we
progress
and
be
innovators
empowering
our
masses
with
education
transforming
the
work
force
by
educating
people
into
new
roles
in
sustainability
and
financing
businesses
to
move
into
the
circular
and
esg
positive
approach


so
my
answer
will
radically
change
depending
on
how
we
spend
the
next
stimulus
and
how
the
government
leads
this
pandemic

"
hopes
"there
is
so
much
potential

we
can
t
imagine
what
will
occur
technologically
in
the
future


with
the
dizzying
acceleration
of
computing
combined
with
the
rapidly
scaling

there
is
tremendous

challenges

transparency

many
ways
to
make
life
easier
for

"
worries
"most
immediately
data
privacy


harvesting
of
data
for
the
financial
gain
of
a
few
as
well
as
using
that
data
profiling
to
manipulate
as
we
saw
with
cambridge
analytica


but
the
scenarios
go
farther

i
m
not
so
keen
on

then
of

the

an
anthropologist

writer
said
"what
will
have
changed
the
most
is
our
sense
of
being
a
part
of
a
community
greater
than
where
we
live
or
work


the
pandemic
reminds
us
that
we
are
affected
by
the
decisions
and
actions
of
those
far
away
from
us
physically
those
whom
we
can
now
reach
much
easier
than
we
could
100
years
ago


i
think
global
conversations
among
the
average
person
in
the
millennial
and
generation
y
cohorts
will
become
the
`new
normal
as
will
wider
efforts
at
co
operation
beyond
government
initiated
cooperation


what
will
have
not
changed
much
at
all


the
percentage
of
people
in
my
country
the
united
states
who
resist
any
sort
of
change
at
all
and
who
resist
cooperation
for
whatever
reason
sexism
racism
an
ego
driven
definition
of
what
liberty
and
freedom
are


they
will
still
be
there
firmly
rooted
and
a
constant
challenge
to
every
bit
of
change
good
and
bad
in
the
years
between
2020
and
2025


perhaps
even
on
a
level
that
involves
violence


as
far
as
technology
is
concerned
i
think
the
new
normal
will
include
a
better
understanding
of
and
strategies
for
dealing
with
the
isolation
and
vulnerability
of
elders
and
those
living
alone
via
technology


i
think
we
will
also
see
an
advancement
in
vr
technology
and
encouragement
to
explore
the
world
that
way


in
fact
previously
crowded
tourist
and
other
destinations
may
cap
the
number
of
attendees
much
live
some
natural

already
do
daily
and
work
to
offer
vr
alternatives
for
those
who
can
t
travel
for
education
and
for
those
locked
out
of
attendance
because
of
the
capping
of
crowds


i
think
we
ll
see
an
even
greater
push
for
access
to
healthcare
perhaps
an
understanding
that
health
care
costs
can
be
out
of
reach
even
for
our
doctors
and
nurses


there
will
be
a
growing
focus
on
the
healthcare
needs
of
families
dealing
with
age
related
dementia
which
will
bring
an
even
greater
focus
on
all
aspects
of
mental
health
care
and
the
burden
to
which
families
and
women
supplement
healthcare
for
the
elderly


i
believe
we
might
find
ourselves
doing
a
fair
bit
more
of
community
and
social
sharing
and
trading
via
technology
as
the
requisite
part
of
being
in
a
community


for
example
the
sharing
of
talent
to
help
parents
entertain
and
educate
children
when
needed


we
ll
also
see
a
greater
intrusion
of
technology
into
our
private
lives
as
not
everyone
has
a
way
to
stage
where
they
engage
in
video
conferencing
as
it
becomes
a
norm
for
everything
from
work
to
family
gatherings
to
hobby
and
trade
meetings
and
events

"
hopes
"i
hope
technology
increases
each
individual
person
s
reach
to
community
and
support
that
it
decreases
isolation
and
that
it
provides
access
to
collaboration
in
areas
that
might
have
been
out
of
reach
for
some

"
worries
"i
worry
that
the
digital
divide
will
only
get
bigger
not
smaller


companies
still
have
too
much
power
over
the
most
basic
element
of
access

technologies

in

it
can
be
impossible
to
get
anything
more
than
a

connection

others
are
zooming
along

this
can
have
enormous
implications
when
it
comes
to
equity
in
education

it
also
limits
us
having
a
shared
culture
shared

be

more
to

criminal

quietly
reformed

public

will

learn

also

simplistic
intolerant

have
eroded
the
basic
civic
virtues
necessary
to
a
healthy
and
inclusive
democracy

"
the
director
of
an
innovation
lab
responded
"the
pandemic
has
accelerated
change
by
increasing
the
breadth
of
shared
experience
and
moving
to
a
critical
mass
of
users
from
online
learning
and
working
remotely
to
cashless
transactions
and
a
broader
scope
online
commerce


where
this
leads
us
is
up
for
grabs
up
to
us
in
some
sense
with
no
guaranteed
progress
or
decline
most
likely
some
of
each


as
we
live
more
digitally
i
hope
we
adjust
in
ways
that
foreground
equity
and
incorporate
the
movement
against
systemic
racism
and
exclusion


this
could
lead
to
expanded
technology
access
treating
broadband
as
a
utility
making
it
not
just
affordably
available
to
all
households
but
a
default
like
water
and
electricity
for
example



we
might
also
become
more
aware
of
and
engaged
with
the
surveillance
economy
taking
a
variety
of
steps
to
address
the
way
our
privacy
is
protected
our
data
is
used
responsibly
and
so
on


more
broadly
this
invokes
a
series
of
changes
at
key
institutions
from
tech
companies
to
journalism
and
higher
education
ranging
from
diversity
and
inclusion
to
reconsidering
how
they
meaningfully
contribute
socially


the
best
outcome
would
be
not
a
gradual
shift
in
these
directions
but
a
collective
realization
that
we
need
to
respond
to
our
increased
reliance
on
technology
for
work
study
play
health
and
everything
else
with
a
robust
public
health
and
environmentally
oriented
set
of
policy
interventions


done
well
this
could
lead
to
improved
access
to
services
better
defaults
and
more
control
over
your
personal
data
services
and
technologies
that
are
designed
for
equity
and
inclusion
and
a
more
complementary
relationship
between
on
and
offline
lives


then
again
we
could
really
screw
it
up
do
nothing
substantial
exacerbate
existing
gaps
and
promote
more
social
and
political
polarization


it
s
our
call

an
expert

"technology
will
be
a
widely

way
to
deliver
mental

have
to
get
good

more

have
access

will
lead
to
increased
inequities


many
societies
will
address
these
with
systematic
improvements

the
u

s


responses
will
move
this
way
with
a
speed
based
on
who
is
control
of
the
white
house
and
congress


the
new

will
include
institutional
attention
to
reducing
infectious
disease

there

a
steady
rise
of
digital

platforms
that
seek
to
heed
the
aphorism

than
being
there
with

systems
that
listen
to
digital

and
provide
updated

additional
materials
collaborative
siri
or
an
attentive
digital

these

rely
on
human
engagement
leveraging
human

to
make

more
useful

allowing
digital
mediation
to
be
preferred
for

production
related
activities


the
blur
of
work
and
non
work
times
moving
ever
more
away
from
the
idea
of

will
lead
to
a
new
set
of

must
participate
in
work


this
will
be
aided
by
shared
workspaces
smart

material
as

will
be
a
rise
in

allow
people
to
maximize

to
support

the
current
move

the
counterpoint

optimistic
me

that

advanced

breaking
things


facebook
being
the
best
example
a
horribly
intrusive/manipulative
system
is
being
recognized
more
broadly
these

because
of
the
stress
of

the

normal

going
to
have
a
lot
less

for

on

the

"the
`new

will
clearly
differ
from
the
pre

period


whether
better
or
worse
depends
on
whom
we
are
addressing


after
a
horribly
polarized
period
for

will
be
a
long
transition

better

a
strengthened
rule
of

catch
up
on
such
needed
projects
as
healthcare
reform

renovation
and
general
pro

reforms


the
countries
that
used
to
look
to
the
u

for
guidance
pre

e

g


europe
uk
japan
india
will
adopt
some

many
of
the
u

s


type
reforms


in
contrast
those
countries
with
very
limited
democratic
structures
may
well
tighten
their
grip
noting
that
the
protests

need
for
centralized
leadership
to
achieve
success
e

g


masks

socializing
constraints
require
at

no
letup

probably
the
need

increased
control


so
the
`new

should
be
improved
for
current
democracies
during

after
a
transition
period
that
might
still
be
underway

president
for
regulatory
affairs

telecommunications
company

potential
scenario
"in
2025
the
response
to
the
covid
19
pandemic
has
disrupted
the
status
quo
way
of
doing
things
and
forced
people
to
find
new
ways
to
function
under
quarantine
and
social
distancing


key
among
those
changes
are
widescale
adoption
of
work
at
home
across
a
broad
range
of
job
functions
and
industries


workers
are
able
to
eliminate
daily
commuting
gaining
back
time
in
their
days
and
reducing
costs
associated
with
drive/public
transportation
to
get
to
work


living
close
to
the
office
is
no
longer
necessary
so
workers
moved
out
of
cities
to
more
remote
suburbs
where
they
could
have
more
space
for
the
same
or
lower
price
as
their
old
rent


companies
need
far
less
office
space
to
support
operations
and
place
more
focus
on
using
company
owned
space
for
functions
that
require
in
person
interactions
or
experiences


needless
to
say
this
has
had
significant
impacts
on
property
values
and
taxes
cities
saw
declines
in
both
and
suburbs
saw
growth


broadband
access
has
become
a
necessity
for
all
and
actions
have
been
taken
to
close
the
remaining
broadband
gaps
rural
deployment
and
low
income
adoption



education
delivery
k
12

secondary
have
been
dramatically
transformed

school
systems

learned
how
to
effectively
use

hope
is
that
universal
broadband
adoption
is
likely
to
become
a
real
priority

will
drive
policy
changes

standing
gaps


this
will

be

because
of
their
importance
they
will
be
under
increasing
scrutiny

a
ceo
and
founder
of
an
agency
helping
people
use
digital
tools
responded
"from
the
standpoint
of
community
covid
19
has
put
a
spotlight
on
those
who
are
not
typically
included


we
live
with
a
misconception
that
`in
real
life
or
`face
to
face
is
the
best
option
and
the
most
representative
one


this
is
often
a
racist
and
ableist
viewpoint
in
my
opinion


the
reality
is
that
there
are
huge
swaths
of
our
society
who
are
unable
or
uncomfortable
with
irl
situations
and
thereby
typically
excluded
yet
we
don
t
notice


for
example
people
living
with
a
disability
whether
physical
or
who
are
neurodiverse
parents
especially
women
of
small
children
and
bipoc


moving
gatherings
and
work
online
has
enabled
people
not
typically
included
to
both
be
more
included
and/or
remove
themselves
from
the
challenges
and
micro
aggressions
that
are
forced
from
irl
cultures


some
examples

alcoholics
anonymous
a
self
organizing
global
entity
is
functioning
almost
entirely
online
and
meetings
appear
to
be
more
diverse

more
access
for
parents
of
young
children
and
the
elderly


people
are
getting
sober
through
aa
online

you
will
need
to
substantiate
this
as
i
have
heard
it
secondhand
but
as
a
seattle
local
i
have
heard
that
amazon
surveyed
its
employees
regarding
preferences
for
working
from
home
and
that
black
women
had
the
highest
preference


ask
them
about
this


it
s
important


3
the
disability
community
has
been
asking
for
accommodations
at
work
such
as
flexible
schedules
and
working
remotely
for
years


they
are
now
receiving
them
in
part
because
everyone
is
receiving
them


my
hope
is
that
when
we
do
return
to
more
`in
person
activities
we
will
be
more
inclusive
and
that
more
online
options
will
available
from
working
remotely
to
more
permanent
online
community
events


many
of
the
misconceptions
about
online
interactions
being
inferior
to
in
person
have
been
tested
and
i
think
we
will
see
that
many
of
those
misconceptions
will
not
hold
up

am
not
typically
concerned

do
worry
about
safeguards
when
it
comes
to
technology
like
facial
recognition
specifically
when
it
is
being
used
against
disenfranchised
communities
or
those
questioning
the
status

such
as

"
a
computer
engineer
replied
"it
will
be
better
in
some
ways
and
worse
in
other
ways


folks
now
realize
the
importance
of
family
of
rest
of
connection
with
other
people
in
a
way
that
was
not
possible
before
the
pandemic


i
would
hope
that
they
will
not
allow
industry
to
take
that
away
from
them
especially
since
many
will
have
accumulated
debts


hopefully
the
cost
of
education
will
go
be
reduced
thanks
to
online
classes
making
it
more
affordable
for
a
larger
part
of
the
population


in
the
move
to
digital
i
have
been
on
more
zoom
calls
with
family
and
friends
than
i
ever
imagined


this
has
led
to
connections
with
people
who
live
farther
away
and
to
a
new
comfort
level
with
the
technology


this
opens
the
door
to
remote
collaboration
and
access
to
people
and
resources
that
were
previously
not
considered
possible
or
normal


the
presence
of
technology
in
daily
life
is
making
the
country
and
the
world
a
smaller
place


this
could
have
the
negative
effect
of
isolating
people
from
their
immediate
surroundings
neighbors
co
workers
etc


more
than
before
the
pandemic


it
depends
on
each
person
s
choice


having
more
neighbors
work
from
home
has
given
me
more
opportunities
to
see
and
greet
my
neighbors
some
of
whom
i
never
knew
existed


i
work
remotely
and
have
for
over
a
year


hopefully
more
people
will
regularly
work
from
home
this
is
good
for
the
environment
less
traffic
and
a
reduction
in
the
need
to
do
fracking
to
get
every
last
ounce
of
gas/oil


hopefully
people
will
become
more
comfortable
on
video
calls
though


it
is
frustrating
to
have
a
call
with
your
team
and
only
one
person
has
the
camera
on


the
technology
will
be
good
for
the
aging
population
who
has
now
learned
to
operate
and
connect
via
video


privacy
is
something
americans
often
overlook
in
the
tradeoff
with
convenience


my
health
insurer
offers
telemedicine
any
time
without
a
co
pay


i
have
not
been
to
a
doctor
in
over
a
year


this
will
become
more
and
more
prevalent

to
wearing

will
wear
them
in

our
health

improve
overall

a
result

during

we
have
laid
the
groundwork
for
some
sort
of
universal
basic
income
whether
that
comes
in
the
form

direct
money
tax
policy

both
and
that
it

no

things
that

this

tracked


we
already
are
and
have
been
for
a
long
time
but
there
will
no
longer
be
a
fight
against
it


our
digital
profile
will
be
like
our
social
security
number
something
required
by
the
government
for
the
public
good

also
used
often
to
exploit

it
s
amazing
to
be

get
what
you

healthiest
choice
to
make
consistently

i
m
concerned
about
what
widespread
implementation
of

would
mean
particularly
for
education


there
is
no
replacing

social
bonds
that
form

be
psychologically
disastrous
for

close

to
have
a

other

tamps
down
your
bravery
and
spontaneous
free
inquiry
to
know
that
you
are
being
recorded
while
you
speak


there
is
a
theory
that
some
young
white
males
have
been
living
this
life
for
a
while


unemployed
subsisting
off
of
an
income
they
didn

personally
earn
for
instance
living
with
parents
and
living
their
entire

through

the
theory
maintains
that
this

unfulfilled


if

"it
s
very
difficult
to
predict
what
the
world
will
look
like
in
2025
in
no
small
part
because
we
know
so
little
about
the
virus
and
therefore
can
t
meaningfully
model
what
additional
system
shocks
we
are
likely
to
endure
from
it


if
it
becomes
endemic
and
recurs
in
a
widespread
way
such
that
most
of
the
population
eventually
becomes
infected
if
it
reinfects
easily
and
is
more
severe
on
reinfection
and
if
it
catalyzes
chronic
health
problems
in
those
infected
are
all
huge
unanswered
questions


equally
uncertain
is
whether
the
response
we
currently
have
to
the
pandemic
remains
stable


already
in
the
united
states
we
have
two
narratives
of
community
pandemic
response


in
the
first
people
came
together
in
unprecedented
solidarity
to
give
authorities
time
to
implement
the
testing
tracing
isolation
and
other
protocols
necessary
to
live
with
the
virus
in
a
controlled
way


this
was
successful
in
slowing
the
spread
of
infection
and
may
have
resulted
in
containment
if
it
had
been
maintained
and
supplemented
with
effective
coordinated
governmental
response


it
was
not
however
and
as
we
see
a
resumption
of
exponential
growth
in
cases
we
are
seeing
less
solidarity
and
more
confusion
frustration
and
nihilism
responses
that
are
likely
to
be
much
less
effective


it
is
tempting
to
suggest
that
as
new
outbreaks
occur
elsewhere
in
the
world
as
they
must
and
as
the
conditions
of
pandemic
wear
on
that
others
will
not
let
frustration
overcome
discipline
and
begin
to
create
false
and
destructive
narratives
around
the
disease
centered
for
example
on
xenophobia
rather
than
collective
action


all
that
said
this
crisis
for
all
its
devastation
has
forced
human
societies
into
natural
experiments
that
would
have
been
unthinkable
before
the
pandemic
for
good
and
bad
reasons


these
experiments
regardless
of
their
motivation
have
given
us
insights
into
our
society
that
we
haven
t
had
and
forced
us
to
confront
implications
that
we
were
avoiding


we
see
fault
lines
in
our
society
better
than
we
ever
have
and
more
people
than
ever
understand
them
as
what
they
are
existential
problems
that
can
t
be
ignored


we
also
see
in
its
omission
how
important
the
role
of
good
central
governance
is
to
maintaining
and
improving
our
society
and
how
important
it
is
to
hold
those
who
are
invested
with
power
in
our
society
accountable
to
those
whom
society
rightly
serves


on
a
smaller
scale
the
pandemic
has
shown
us
the
tremendous
value
telecommunications
has
in
our
lives
both
in
staying
in
touch
with
each
other
and
in
enabling
commerce


it
has
demonstrated
that
we
need
physical
co
location
much
less
than
we
thought
diminishing
the
importance
of
both
geography
and
physical
ability
to
enterprise
hiring
and
making
it
easier
than
ever
to
bring
more
diverse
voices
into
the
enterprise
just
as
we
are
starting
to
truly
appreciate
the
need
for
such
diversity


discussions
surrounding
diversity
and
equity
have
caused
us
to
reevaluate
the
pervasive
use
of
machine
learning
and
big
data
acquisition
and
analysis
with
an
eye
again
toward
diversity
and
community


combined
with
a
new
appreciation
for
the
role
of
government
in
ensuring
a
just
and
safe
society
i
expect
the
field
to
become
more
heavily
scrutinized
both
by
those
outside
the
big
data
community
and
by
its
own
practitioners


this
trend
is
already
happening
along
with
a
rising
consciousness
among
those
practitioners
that
they
have
an
ethical
responsibility
independent
of
that
of
their
employers
and
a
moral
responsibility
to
oppose
them
if
they
believe
they
are
acting
against
the
public
interest


the
net
effect
is
a
society
coming
to
truly
appreciate
how
it
is
broken
how
broken
it
is
and
taking
responsibility
for
fixing
it


if
these
trends
continue
and
absent
more
unforeseen
system
shocks
i
fail
to
see
how
the
world
can
be
worse
in
five

and
ban

spaces

"
a
researcher
focused
on
the
evolution
of
digital
and
political
communication
noted
"the
`new
normal
will
highly
depend
on
political
leadership
and
each
country
s
commitment
to
liberal
democracy


assuming
that
political
leadership
is
based
on
evidence
based
decision
making
the
`new
normal
for
the
average
person
will
consist
most
likely
out
of
a
more
robust
healthcare
system
as
well
as
a
social
security
net


healthcare
would
not
be
bound
to
employment
and
unemployment
would
be
bolstered
by
a
robust
social
security
system
that
is
built
around
the
understanding
that
losing
a
job
can
affect
everyone
and
is
not
centered
around
someone
s
skills


as
additional
wish
i
would
hope
for
society
s
understanding
that
the
jobs
that
are
now
seen
as
`essential
will
also
get
treated
and
rewarded
as
such
going
forward


work
with
regard
to
daily
routines
i
would
argue
that
many
industries
now
understand
that
working
out
of
an
office
is
not
necessary
for
many
jobs
and
thus
more
flexible
options
will
be
made
available


this
however
will
come
with
issues
1
under
privileged
people
will
still
be
not
part
of
these
possibilities


2
flexible
workplace/workhours
will
come
with
severe
mental
stress
that
will
have
to
be
dealt
with


3
this
might
have
an
impact
on
bolstering
rural
areas
where
people
will
now
be
able
to
work
without
having
to
commute


well
being
part
of
the
new
normal
will
be
dealing
with
the
ramifications
of
covid
19


this
is
in
part
about
health


we
still
do
not
know
about
the
mid
to
long
term
damages
covid
19
will
have
for
infected
people


it
is
likely
that
this
will
most
likely
affect
vulnerable
populations
and
that
this
divide
between
healthy
and
sick
will
also
be
detectable
by
race
and
class
so
similar
to
what
we
are
seeing
already
everywhere
in
the
world



how
each
country
decides
to
deal
with
this
societal
trauma
will
decide
each
society
s
well
being


if
a
society
acknowledges
the
trauma
and
the
long
term
effects
it
will
have
to
offer
treatment
options
and
center
healthcare
around
people
not
money


if
society
and
political
leadership
is
willing
to
do
so
well
being
on
average
will
be
better


for
the
u

s


although
i
have
hope
i
am
skeptical
as
this
change
would
require
a
serious
shift
in
the
political
landscape
on
a
state
level


rather
i
will
say
that
the
well
being
similar
to
now
will
be
told
by
red/blue
state
and
wealth/race
parameters


and
indeed
i
believe
that
for
the
middle
and
upper
class
the
well
being
will
be
improved


they
will
profit
off
of
health
care
changes
in
employment
see
above
and
tax
breaks


for
vulnerable
populations
i
have
little
hope
that
well
being
will
improve


based
on
where
they
live
in
the
u

s


they
will
still
have
to
work
several
jobs
have
little
to
no
health
care
and
be
exposed
to
a
hyper
capitalist
logic
that
sees
them
as
replaceable
and
not
as
human
beings


privacy
this
will
get
worse
unfortunately


working
from
home
tele
visits
smartphones
smart
tvs
home
surveillance
data
brokers
etc


will
all
contribute
to
a
loss
of
privacy


as
we
see
in
the
eu
the
gdpr
is
hardly
helping
in
protecting
citizen
s
privacy


in
the
u

s


there
are
few
attempts
to
even
do
so


rather
the
government
see
obama
before
has
shown
a
disdain
for
privacy


this
won
t
get
better


a
social
capital
system
like
in
china
is
not
too
impossible
for
the
u

s


i
believe
economic
security
will
be
on
the
axis
between
rich/poor


middle
and

the

i
would
like
to
be
true
is
that
everyone
develops
a
greater
sense
of
community
care
for
each
other


the
analogy
i
use
is
that
of
smoking


while
we
accept
that
smoking
is
a
personal
choice
we
have
come
a
long
way
in
realizing
that
one
person
s
personal
choice
directly
affects
others


as
a
result
many
changes
have
in
the
use
of
common

community
accessible
areas
has
developed
e

g


limited
indoor
smoking
and
controlled
outdoor
smoking


this
recent
pandemic
has
created
a
heightened
awareness
of
how
we
directly
affect
each
other


the
`new
normal
has
to
incorporate
new
guidance
for
how
we
take
care
of
each
other


the
issue
of
`masks
is
the
canonical
example
here
today


video
conferencing
is
becoming
normalized


this
is
good
and
bad


on
the
upside
it
is
great
to
have
a
more
efficient
method
of
working
together


we
re
learning
its
limitations


there
really
is
value
in
being
in
the
same
room
with
someone


but
we
re
leveraging
the
value
of
online
face
to
face


it
saves
time
and
requires
less
physical
travel
and
it
is
more
personal
than
a
simple
phone
call


however
the
seedy
underbelly
is
the
lack
of
security
and
privacy


`zoom
bombing
briefly
became
a
new
thing


culturally
do
we
really
have
that
much
disregard
for
each
other
that
we
have
to
do
such
things


from
a
technology
perspective
are
we
really
in
it
just
to
make
money
and
thus
security
is
a
second
priority


the
average
internet
user
will
always
expect
that
things
work
they
are
supposed
to
work


business
will
always
be
in
it
to
make
money


so
the
new
normal
will
be
a
greater
reliance
on
technology
even
to
the
point
of
tracking
people
and
even
less
security
and
privacy
because
average
people
won
t
even
know
it
matters
and
isn
t
working

"
hopes
"two
things


first
our
digital
infrastructure
needs
help


the
requirement
here
is
that
if
we
re
going
to
rely
on
more
technology
then
we
need
to
be
able
to
support
it


at
the
most
basic
level
this
means
greater
bandwidth
to
everywhere


however
that
s
simplistic
because
bandwidth
costs
money
and
distributing
that
cost
is
itself
problematic
for
a
variety
of
policy
reasons


so
there
s
some
real
discussion
to
be
had
here


second
security
and
privacy
has
to
be
the
default
everywhere


this
is
not
trivial


in
the
u

s


in
particular
but
in
other
places
as
well
the
average
internet
user
doesn
t
even
realize
how
insecure
and
public
everything
they
do
is


we
have
built
up
a
usage
of
`free
services
based
on
giving
up
security
and
privacy
and
we
have
not
made
this
clear
to
people


nor
has
business
bothered
to
be
open
about
it


there
is
movement
towards
greater
confidentiality
everywhere
i

e


the
use
of
encryption
but
without
a
baseline
requirement
the
rules
change
at
will
as
business
and
services
change
owners
for
features
and
usage


we
need
an
overarching
vision
and
a
commitment
to
its
success

lack
of
security
and

the
downstream
consequences
of
it

the
medical

insurance

huge
frankly
lethal

some
protection

the
problem
with
privacy
is
that
once

it

gone
forever


it
cannot
be
recovered


so
what
happens
when
suddenly
everyone
knows
everything
there
is
to
know
about
you
and
insurance
companies
take
advantage
of
that


this
is
a
real
issue
among
others
and
that
s
what
scares
me
the
most
about
technology


it
takes
problems
like
these
which
could
be
small
if
it
was
just
a
few
individuals

it

is
just
wrong

risk
others

after
some
sort
of
significant
emotional
event
may
place
them

proper
procedures

activities


on
the
social

side
the
toxicity
that
is
out
today
is
slightly
wilting

an
immune

it
will
improve

over

shut
their

there
are
no

the
country
is
trying
to
open
its
borders
to
restore
industry
within
the
island
but
there
is
reluctance
by
many
locals
who
don
t
work
in
the
tourism
industry
or
at
least
rely
on
it
because
we
didn
t
have
covid
on

it
here


the

has
to
rethink
its
priorities

encourage
industries

have
to
do
things
differently


the

out


it

have
the

great

access


if
it

it
could
be
an

attracting

bring

we

self

outside

as
the
current
pandemic
can
be
upon
us
at

if
we
are
not
prepared
as
we
were
not
for
the
broader
impacts
of
covid
in
2020
on
our
small
island
then
we
only
have
ourselves
to
blame


smaller
homestays
may
become
the
norm
rather
than
the
sprawling
accommodations
that
we
built
to
bring
in
thousands
of
tourists
each
year
who
changed
our
landscape
into
a
plastic
mess
and
into
an
alcohol
culture
which
was
not
a
good
model
of
society
for
our
young
people


not
having
tourists
on
the
island
has
been
a
bonus
for
island
families
with
young
families


we
have
to
focus
on
a
different
type
of
tourist
in
the
future

from

hopes
"the
technology
related
changes
that
i

hope
for
are
ones
that
change
the
interfaces
whether
physical

virtual
through
which
we
access
the

it
closer
to
a

reality
such
that
one
gets
to
express

in

this

that
perform
at

then
i

organises
itself
with

what
we

slowly
begin
to
measure
how
much
of
an
impact
these
companies
have
on
our
lives
as
human
beings
and
how
necessary
they
are


tech
companies
often
set
out
to
remove
redundancies
that
exist

reduce
inefficiencies
that
may
exist
in

day

lives

that
doesn

come
for

we
are
often
called
to
make
a
choice
of
being
exposed
and
managing
the
consequence
later
or
not
joining
the
bandwagon
in
the
first
place


some
software
and
machines
that
provide
a
value
of
some
kind
also
do
more
than
what
they
were
initially
designed
to
do
therefore
leaving
room
for
possibilities
that
may
expose
the
vulnerability
of
a
person
or
create
some
form
of
discomfort
even
when
the
value
provided
is
critical


in
certain
parts
of
the
world
there
s
no
way
to
hold
the
companies
accountable
for
that
and
that
is
unfair


these
tech
companies
need
to
ensure
that
they
have
well
defined
and
respected
policies
wherever
their
products
can
be
distributed
and
used


if
i
buy
an
iphone
in
africa
usually
in
the
informal
market
there
s
no
way
to
claim
damages
incurred
from
the
use
of
a
given
app
or
the
device
itself
from
apple
because
there
s
no
specific
policy
for
africans
about
how
apple
products
are
expected
to
be
used
in

area
and
what

companies
need
to
do
better
in
protecting
the
moral
integrity
and
safety
of
their
consumers
and
also
provide
clear
information
about
any
changes
they
make

cautiously

supported
by

technology
could
create
more
employment
opportunities
across
a
wider
geographic
region
be
more
inclusive

encourage

while

are
efficient
and
offer
advantages
to
residents
they
have
costs
although
they
do
seem
to
be
resilient

the
book

we
could
reduce
transportation
congestion
pollution
energy
consumption
and
lower
the
cost
of
living
for
much
of
the
population
of
course
employers
will
align
pay
to
cost
of
living



the
current
crisis
has
exposed
our
fragile
supply
chains


their
brittle
structures
have
led
to
both
scarcity
and
waste

as
hardship
technology
could
help
reestablish
regional
production

distribution
and
supply
chain
agility
responding

black
swan
events
as

simple
shifts
in
consumer
demand

the
inability
of
food
supply
chains
to
move
from
restaurant
and
institutional
supply
to
consumer
supply
is
a
sad
state
of
affairs


telemedicine
implementation
might
finally
get
serious
in
order
to
provide
wider
access
to
health
care
at
lower
costs
to
more
of
the
population
a
lesson
that
should
be
learned
from
the
current
crisis
is
the
population
s
health
and
welfare
is
everyone
s
problem
if
not
attended

technology
can
increase
the
resiliency

bit
more
attention

i
applaud

their
users

will
see
how
this
unfolds

is
amoral
irresponsible

how

to
undermine

escalate
division
at
scale
and
for
a
profit


it
s
hard
to
understand
how
facebook
s
executive
team
can
live
with
themselves


society
needs
clarity
either
a
firm
is
a
common
carrier
and
should
be
regulated
as
such
or
a
firm
must
take
responsibility
for
the
traffic
on

network


while
i
agree
that
amazon
s
human
resources
policies
need
a
lot
of
improvement
i
m
not
so
worried
about
amazon
microsoft
google
and
apple
there
is
plenty
of
competition


for
example
the
fuss
over
apple
s
app
store
policies
seems
rather
silly
it
is
their
platform
and
relative
to
installed
base
apple
s
market
share
is
small
and
faces
a
lot
of
competition


society
would
be
better
served

on
the
abuses

unreasonable
productivity
measurement
systems

health

another
example
spotify
s
claims
of
unfair
treatment
are
just
ludicrous
from
a
firm

has
practically
institutionalized
cheating

how
do
we
solve
the
bigger
issue

a
lack
of
investment
in

accounting
systems

the
use
of

early
to
tell
where
this
will
lead
however
there
are
issues
that

inadvertently

i
m
skeptical


this

work

gain
acceptance

regular

the

signaling

trends
toward
remote

as
telemedicine

will
continue

they
have
probably
been
given
a
boost

academic
events

i

the
tribal

decide
to
hold
some
events
remotely
when
they
might
not
have
done
so
in

past
in

to
save
money


i
d
be
surprised
to
see
radical
change
however


i
find
that
i
like
zoom
sessions

a

of
people
will
be
delighted
to
go
back
to
doing
everything
in

hopes
"i
see
a
lot
of
areas
where
ai
can
be
helpful
from
running
the
electricity
grid
more
efficiently
with
fewer

to
the
development
of

ideally
ai
could
also
empower

to
make
more
effective

make
better

when
i
refer
to

what
i
have
in

is
more
a
matter
of
incremental
improvements
in
machine
learning
than
any
radical
breakthrough

not

of

next

so

a
co
founder
of
a

project
said
"a
great
deal
depends
on
our
society

response
to
the

there
is
great
potential
for
transformation
of
how

operates


with
the
convergence
of
the

incredible
influence

resilience
of
the
black
lives
matter
movement
and
the
clear
need
to
address
climate
issues
the
possibilities
of
transforming
cities
for
example
are
very
great


the
experiments
in
new
york
and
milan
to
challenge
the
automobile
s
dominance
of
those
cities
if
they
are
allowed
to
develop

greatly
change
their

are
happening
in
smaller
locales


with
the
likelihood
that
working
from
home
will
increase
the
need
for
everyday
commutes
may
fall


these
changes
will
not
be
foreordained
by
the
pandemic

will
depend
on
what
citizens
demand
and
how
policymakers
act

"
hopes
"i
m
very
skeptical
about
`technology
itself

life
better


certainly
the
technology
needed
to
sequence
the

a
vaccine
and
improve
treatments
will
be
very
important


in
the
communication/ai
space

it
is
not
clear
to
me
that
advances
being
made
are
likely
to
improve
the
quality
of
life
for
many
people


self
driving
cars
for
example
were
a
hot
topic
five
to
10
years
ago
but
they
have
not
advanced
as
expected
and
the
claim
that
they
would
reduce
city
congestion
was
always
a
hoax


policy
will
play
a
much
larger
role
in
the
quality
of
life
for
americans
in
2025

"
worries

how

about

a

predicted

the

fact
about

the
massive

will
not
much
change

very
far

likely
still
hold
enormous
numbers
of
men
of
color
and
if
people
think
that
tucker
carlson
could
run
for
president
in
2024
that
means
a
lot
of
people
don
t
understand
the
systemic
racism
that
is
a
knee
on
the
throat
of
black
people


oh
i
forgot
sexism
i
m
male
so
of
course
i
did



between
#metoo
and
the
hatred
aimed
at
hillary
it
s
obvious
that
we
have
some
really
serious
misogyny
problems


making
*this*
society
more
fair
and
less
racist
is
a
marathon
and
not
a
five
year
sprint


of
course
global
warming
like
pandemics
is
part
of
this
dynamic
as
well


and
aside
from
early
mentions
by
democrats
like
jay
inslee
this
issue
has
been
driven
out
of
our
collective
consciousness
by
all
the
stupid
trump
stuff


really
trump
is
the
cautionary
tale


i
was
pretty
hopeful
when
obama
was
elected


i
was
quite
shocked
when
trump
beat
hillary


that
frankly
is
the
reason
why
i
can
t
be
optimistic


that
close
to
half
the
voters
were
willing
to
elect
a
person
who
is
racist
stupid
sociopathic
and
narcissistic
indeed
that
good
christians
could
vote
for
such
a

because
they
wanted

that
a
very
large
portion

america

in

a

time
period
the
key
realities

the
powerful
racism

hopes
"my

pretty
good


i

for

worse
off
than
me
and
of

for
my

face

very

at

grand
level

we
use

to
preserve
our

of

maybe
a

worry

exacerbates

amplifies
extant

perhaps
worst
that
it

course
i
don
t
blame
technology
per
se


rush
limbaugh
and
fox
news
did/do
their
damage
with
old
technologies
of
radio
and

in
my
opinion
fox

has
done
way
more
to
pollute
what
once
could
be
called
civic
discourse
than
infowars
breitbart

daily

"
a
professor
of
cognitive
science
and
artificial
intelligence
based
in
new
zealand
said
"we
can
t
know
whether
things
will
improve
or
get
worse


we
re
at
a
turning
point


what
happens
in
the
next
few
months
will
have
a
big
influence
on
the
direction
the
world
takes

"
hopes
"my
hope
is
that
we
make
many
changes


the
main
change
is
greater
governmental
and
societal
oversight
of
the
big
tech
companies


these
companies
are
hugely
influential
in
determining
how
information
flows
within
society
and
i
believe
many
of
the
trends
towards
authoritarianism
and
nationalism
that
we
see
in
world
politics
are
due
to
the
new
dynamics
of
information
in
society


these
flows
need
to
be
better
studied
and
understood
and
the
big
companies
are
not
good
at
participating
in
the
necessary
studies
they
have
a
conflict
of
interest


when
we
have
understood
better
how
information
flows
within
social
networks
and
other
internet
networks
the
big
companies
need
to
devote
more
resources
to
regulating
these
flows


they
are
already
imposing
censorship
through
recommender
engines
but
the
current
censorship
is
guided
mainly
by
profit
or
public
relations
motives
rather
than
the
social
good


democratic
governments
need
to
guide
the
way
censorship
happens
just
as
they
impose
broadcasting
standards
and
regulations


big
tech
companies
are
publishers
of
information
when
they
circulate
it
broadly


i
also
hope
for
a
reduction
in
the
global
inequality
that
has
been
exacerbated
by
the
big
tech
companies


on
the
ai
front
i
hope
the
countries
of
the
world
can
agree
on
a
ban
on
killer
robots

worries
"my
worry
is
that
the
changes
i
hope
for
do
not
come
to
pass

"
a
consultant
expert
in
technical
regulatory
and
business
issues
said
"while
greater
use
of
telepresence
will
be
helpful
for
many
people
and
potentially
reduce
commuting
and
concomitant
road
traffic
it
may
also
lead
to
more
social
isolation
and
social
division


meeting
fewer
people
will
make
it
easier
to
exclude
`others


"
hopes
"my
hope
is
for
more
privacy
in
the
tech
world
it
is
now
dominated
by
surveillance
capitalism

"
worries
"my
worry
is
a
near
future
with
even
more
surveillance
capitalism
with
sale
of
personal
data
becoming
intrusive
in
many
aspects
of
life

"
a
professor
of
international
affairs
and
economics
at
washington
dc
area
university
wrote
"obviously
there
are
two
scenarios


the
first
is
that
a
solution
to
the
covid
19
infection
crisis
will
be
implemented
and
life
will
return
more
or
less
to
what
it
once
was
minus
our
family
friends
and
acquaintances
who
have
died
from
the
disease


we
will
have
improved
our
facility
with
remote
technologies
and
this
in
turn
should
bring
down
our
need
to
travel
as
much
to
distant
venues
for
interacting
with
colleagues
around
the
world


it
might
even
alter
the
way
we
are
`at
work
allowing
remote
meetings
to
become
more
mainstream


this
would
mean
fewer
commutes
through
the
busy
washington
d

c


traffic


clearly
we
would
return
to
the
usual
way
of
delivering
classes
in
higher
education
but
with
a
greatly
enhanced
technological
toolkit
with
which
to
present
material
and
interact
with
students


the
second
scenario
would
be
one
in
which
covid
19
is
with
us
simmering
beneath
the
surface
for
years
to
come


clearly
we
will
discover
additional
coping
mechanisms
for
having
more
personal
interactions
while
staying
safe


however
it
s
clear
that
a
majority
of
interactions
would
have
to
remain
online
or
at
a
distance


i
am
presuming
that
in
this
case
new
technologies
will
arise
that
will
allow
clearer
communication
from
a
distance
and
under
a
mask


we
are
currently
using
our
telephones
for
this
as
relatives
quarantine
and
friends
gather
at
a
distance


there
will
be
many
more
events
outdoors
so
there
will
be
a
greater
need
for
public
space
and
less
need
for
traditional
indoor
gathering
places


employment
security
will
depend
on
the
ability
to
carry
on
providing
services
and
products
while
minimizing
risks


if
markets
worked
well
which
i
assume
they
will
not
the
wages
for
people
in
more
exposed
or
dangerous
jobs
would
rise


my
guess
is
that
in
this
environment
there
would
be
an
incentive
to
invest
in
all
sorts
of
protective
technologies


we
may
discover
that
some
workers
are
relatively
immune
to
the
virus
and
hence
be
more
willing
to
work
in
jobs
that
expose
them

"
hopes
"technology
can
close
gaps
between
people
in
ways
that
they
would
never
be
able
to
do
in
real
life
so
devoting
some
thought
to
how
technology
creates
community
might
yield
a
big
payoff


also
much
of
what
is
shared
online
and
is
held
up
as
`news
is
difficult
to
source


a
great
deal
of
effort
should
be
paid
to
technologies
that
allow
people
to
verify
who
is
responsible
for
a
given
story
or
where
a
particular
product
has
been
made

"
worries
"the
internet
is
a
public
good
and
should
be
treated
as
such


many
have
made
billions
by
exploiting
this
public
good


it
s
time
for
governments
and
other
representatives
of
the
people
to
claim
back
our
rights


the
existing
model
by
which
companies
extract
information
from
individuals
and
sell
or
otherwise
monetize
that
information
has
shifted
power
from
the
individual
to
these
large
entities


given
how
new
technologies
have
been
created
and
then
regulated
in
the
past
it
strikes
me
that
it
s
time
for
countries
or
groups
of
countries
to
regulate
what
has
been
monopolized
due
to
the
obvious
economies
of
scale


an
unregulated
net
will
lead
to
a
greater
concentration
of
power

money

the
director
of

group
exploring
the
future
of
lifelong
learning
commented
"i
suspect
that
online
education
particularly
for
higher
education
will
increase
with
some
potential
benefits
for
broadening
access


however
i
m
also
concerned
that
the
quality
of
remote
education
will
not
improve
substantially
or
produce
the
same
learning
outcomes
as
in
class
instruction


it
is
likely
that
many
companies
may
support
remote
work
as
some
tech
companies
are
already
starting
to
do
but
it
s
possible
this
will
lead
to
reduced
benefits
and
job
security
for
many
people
office
jobs
translated
into
remote
working
positions
may
be
treated
more
like
freelance
or
contracting
positions


existing
and
emerging
remote
collaboration
technologies
particularly
immersive
technologies
like
vr
and
ar
offer
some
opportunities
here
but
there
remain
substantial
technical
problems
to
be
solved
for
these
domains


while
it
s
likely
that
remote
learners
and
workers
will
rely
on
some
form
of
ar
in
the
future
many
fundamental
technical
challenges
will
still
exist
and
video
conferencing
will
likely
still
be
dominant


it
will
also
be
interesting
to
see
how
long
term
efforts
for
social
justice
and
equity
will
impact
the
development
and
use
of
contentious
technologies
like
facial
recognition
algorithmic
risk
assessment
and
audio
and
video
synthesis


while
there
will
be
short
term
pushback
on
some
of
these
technologies
i
m
pessimistic
about
the
likelihood
that
companies
and
academics
who
work
in
these
areas
will
reduce
efforts
in
these
areas
in
the
future


facial
recognition
and
other
data
driven
machine
learning
based
algorithms
for
categorizing
and
evaluating
people
will
unfortunately
be
a
large
part
of
our
society
in
the
future

"
a
longtime
leader
in
internet
engineering
said
"things
are
going
to
be
different
from
how
they
are
now
but
will
they
be
better
or
worse


some
aspects
will
be
better


i
doubt
we
will
see
again
in
our
lifetimes
people
jumping
on
planes
for
professional
purposes
the
way
they
did
previously


that
s
good
for
the
environment
and
for
families


it
may
also
have
other
benefits
in
terms
of
congested
regions
where
working
from
home
will
become
a
bit
more
of
the
norm
and
so
people
will
move
to
other
locales


on
the
other
hand
we
must
not
kid
ourselves


our
children
are
suffering
the
effects
of
this
pandemic
in
terms
of
having
to
`distance
learn
which
is
not
natural
and
all
of
us
are
not
able
to
socialize
as
humans
are
meant
to
do


no
facetime
or
zoom
or
webex
can
substitute
for
a
hug

"
an
expert
in
political
science
observed
"some
changes
will
be
good
for
some
but
not
good
for
others


there
is
class
race
and
gender
intersectionality
that
helps
us
understand
whose
life
might
be
improved
versus
those
whose
will
not


for
example
public
education
might
be
drastically
changed
and
those
changes
could
be
of
benefit
for
wealthier
and
white
families
but
detrimental
for
those
without
the
same
degree
of
wealth
or
access
to
education
choices
beyond
public
schools


same
with
caring
for
family
women
are
more
likely
to
bear
the
burden
of
childcare
and
domestic
responsibilities


age
will
also
make
a
difference
in
outcomes


economic
stability
employment
and
retirement
funds
will
be
harder
to
find
for
younger
generations
who
have
incurred
more
debt
and
less
economic
wealth
accumulation
than
older
generations


technology
will
be
much
more
a
part
of
our
life
than
it
is
already


during
the
past
five
months
or
so
people
across
the
spectrum
have
used
technology
in
ways
that
were
not
as
typical
pre
pandemic


in
particular
faculty/teachers
and
students
were
all
forced
online
and
this
might
dramatically
change
the
way
we
educate
and
the
reliance
on
technology
in
different
ways
for
teaching/learning

"
hopes
"my
hope
is
that
access
to
technology
is
democratic
so
that
poorer
communities
or
individuals
have
access
to
common
technologies
so
that
they
are
not
left
out
and
behind

"
worries
"i
worry
over
the
collection
and
abuse
of
personal
data
and
privacy

"
the
head
of
a
major
pan
european
media
organization
commented
"until
the
end
of
the
20th
century
western
democracies
were
convinced
that
there
could
be
no
real
economic
development
without
democratic
regimes


the
collapse
of
communist
regimes
somewhat
provoked
by
the
arrival
of
networked
personal
computers
created
the
illusion
that
ideologies
were
dead
and
that
development
and
democracy
are
a
permanent
and
unavoidable
couple


then
the
economic
rise
of
china
came
to
prove
that
this
axiom
was
not
necessarily
true
it
proved
that
state
capitalism
can
prosper
without
democracy
provided
that
citizens
are
able
to
share
in
the
wealth
finding
consumer
goods
and
the
cultivation
of
well
being
to
be
more
accessible
to
all


the
internet
and
digitalization
could
provide
a
surrogate
for
democracy
while
at
the
same
time
allowing
undemocratic
states
to
exercise
mass
control
via
the
new
internet
tools


we
understand
that
amazon
or
alibaba
services
are
not
democratic
per
se
and
can
be
used
for
the
bad
or
for
the
good
depending
on
the
ethical
principles
on
which
they
are
built
and
depending
on
whether
democratic
control
if
any
is
exercised
on
them
or
not

"
the
co
director
of
a
center
for
the
study
of
war
and
peace
wrote
"i
disagree
with
any
effort
to
oversimplify
what
will
be
`good
or
`better
or
`bad
or
`worse
as
we
adjust
to
a
post
covid
19
world


i
am
fairly
certain
that
we
will
live
through
big
changes
but
these
will
likely
be
disruptions
some
major
and
some
minor


i
do
not
think
that
there
is
someone
who
can
be
reasonably
called
`the
average
person
for
this
sort
of
analysis


rather
we
will
see
how
some
practices
such
as
perceptions
of
online
education
or
the
idea
that
work
requires
big
offices
will
change
radically
in
ways
that
are
both
`good
and
`bad
but
not
necessarily
leading
to
an
industry
collapse


on
the
other
hand
many
thousands
of
businesses
will
never
recover
restaurants
small
shops
etc


and
this
will
produce
massive
economic
dislocation
as
well
as
great
suffering
for
those
who
have
invested
so
much
of
their
lives
in
small
family
owned
enterprises


many
big
companies
will
survive
and
many
smaller
ones
will
fail


we
will
continue
to
witness
major
changes
in
all
of
the
areas
you
outline
in
the
question
security
privacy
employment
economic
security
etc

"
hopes
"tech
will
clearly
improve
all
sorts
of
information
sharing
even
as
it
will
continue
to
create
new
risks
and
shifting
understandings
of
what
life
is
all
about


many
aspects
of
online
servicing
increase
efficiency
and
access


i
run
an
online
master
s
degree
program
and
we
can
teach
people
who
work
full
time
raise
families
and
live
anywhere
in
the
world


almost
none
of
these
students
could
set
aside
their
lives
move
to
arizona
and
study
full
time


in
medicine
we
will
see/are
seeing
some
similar
benefits


for
many
types
of
routine
care
taking
half
the
day
to
see
a
physician
or
nurse
provides
no
positive
benefits


and
in
far
deeper
ways
it
would
be
wonderful
if
this
crisis
would
yield
a
more
expansive
u

s


safety
net
greater
respect
and
protections
for
lower
wage
workers
and
greater
trust
in
a
more
robust
and
effective
government

worries
"we
need
a
new
language
and
new
rules/ideas
for
managing
tech
and

companies

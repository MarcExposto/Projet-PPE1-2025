from

asking
them
to
share
their
answer
to
the
following
the
question
life
in
2025


there
have
been
significant
debates
since
the
emergence
of
covid
19
about
its
potential
impact
on
global
society


much
of
the
conversation
has
centered
on
the
transformation
of
peopleâs
social
interactions
their
physical
and
mental
health
economic
and
social
divisions
the
nature
of
work
and
jobs
local
national
and
global
politics
climate
change
and
the
globalization
of
goods
and
services


of
course
the
evolution
of
people
and
technology
could
play
a
major
role
across
some
aspects
of
the
ânew
normalâ
in
the
years
to
come


what
do
you
envision
the
ânew
normalâ
for
digital
life
will
be
in
2025


consider
the
changes
that
are
being
set
in
motion
by
the
covid
19
outbreak
and
the
way
societies
are
responding


do
you
predict
these
changes
will
lead
to
life
in
2025
that
is
mostly
better
for
most
people
mostly
worse
for
most
people
or
not
much
different
for
most
people
than
life
was
at
the
time
the
pandemic
began


915

answered
the
question
*
about
47%
said
life
will
be
mostly
worse
for
most
people
in
2025
than
when
the
pandemic
began


*
about
39%
said
life
will
be

better
for
most
people
in

*
about
14%
said
life
in
2025
will
not
be
much
different
for
most
people
than
before
the
pandemic
began
in

they
were
asked
to
elaborate
on
their
choice
with
these
prompts
if
you
expect
change
what
do
you
think
the
ânew
normalâ
will
be
for
the
average
person
in
2025


what
will
have
changed
most


what
will
not

much
at
all


we
are
particularly
interested
in
what
you
think
will
happen
to
the
way
people
use
and
think
about
technology


please
describe
what
you
think
the
ânew
normalâ
will
look
like
with
regard
to
the
role
of
digital
technologies
in
individualsâ
personal
and
professional
lives
their
daily
routines
their
well
being
their
privacy
their
employment
and
economic
security


what
hopes
do
you
have
for
tech

changes
that
might
make
life
better
in
coming
years


what
worries
you
about
the
role
of
technology
and
technology
companies
in
individualsâ
lives
in
2025


the
full
report
with
organized
analysis
of
responses
is
here
among
the
key
themes
emerging
in
the
915
respondentsâ
overall
answers
were
*
emerging
change
â
tele
everything
is
embraced
the
broad
adoption
of
âremoteâ
processes
â
tele
work
tele
medicine
virtual
schooling
e
commerce
and
more
â
is
growing


in
2025
there
will
be
more
people
working
from
home
more
virtual
social
and
entertainment
interactions
fewer
forays
in
public
than
has
been
in
the
case
in
recent
years


â
humansâ
yearning
for
convenience
and
safety
fuels
reliance
on
digital
tools
the
pandemic
has
rearranged
incentives
so
that
consumers
will
be
more
willing
to
seek
out
smart
gadgets
apps
and
systems


this
will
speed
up
adoption
of
new
education
and
learning
platforms
rearrange
work
patterns
and
workplaces
change
family
life
and
upend
living
arrangements
and
community
structures


â
the
best
and
worst
of
human
nature
are
amplified
the
crisis
is
enhancing
digital
interconnectedness
that
engenders
empathy
better
awareness
of
the
ills
facing
humanity
and
positive
public
action


on
the
flip
side
some
individuals
cities
and
nation
states
will
become
more
insular
and
competitive
as
survival
mode
kicks
in


xenophobia
bigotry
and
closed
communities
will
also
increase


*
worries
for
2025
â
inequality
and
injustice
are
magnified
the
pandemic
and
quick
pivot
to
the
use
of
digitally
driven
systems
will
widen
divides
and
expand
the
ranks
of
the
unemployed
uninsured
and
disenfranchised


the
power
imbalances
between
the
advantaged
and
disadvantaged
are
being
magnified
by
digital
systems
overseen
by
behemoth
firms
as
they
exploit
big
data
and
algorithmic
decision
making
that
are
often
biased


more
people
will
be
pushed
into
a
precarious
existence
that
lacks
predictability
economic
security
and
wellness


â
as
risk
grows
security
must
also
privacy
falls
and
authoritarianism
rises
the
health
crisis
spawned
by
the
pandemic
and
broader
dependence
people
have
on
the
internet
heighten
threats
of
criminal
activity
hacks
and
other
attacks


optimized
security
solutions
may
further
reduce
individualsâ
privacy
and
civil
liberties


they
are
likely
to
expand
mass
surveillance
as
authoritarian
states
will
use
this
as
an
opportunity
to
silence
dissent
and
abuse
citizensâ
civil
rights


â
threats
to
work
will
intensify
from
automation
artificial
intelligence
robotics
and
globalization
in
order
to
survive
businesses
are
reconfiguring
systems
and
processes
to
automate
as
many
aspects
as
possible


while
artificial
intelligence
ai
and
robotics
will
enhance
some
lives
they
will
damage
others
as
more
work
is
taken
over
by
machines


employers
may
outsource
labor
to
the
lowest
bidder
globally


employees
may
be
asked
to
work
for
far
less
they
may
have
to
shift
to
be
gig
and
contract
workers
supplying
their
own
equipment
and
they
may
be
surveilled
at
home
by
employers


â
misinformation
will
be
rampant
digital
propaganda
is
unstoppable
and
the
rapidly
expanding
weaponization
of
cloud
based
technologies
divides
the
public
deteriorates
social
cohesion
and
threatens
rational
deliberation
and
evidence
based
policymaking


â
peopleâs
mental
health
will
be
challenged
digital
life
was
already
high
stress
for
some
people
prior
to
the
required
social
isolation
brought
on
by
the
pandemic


the
shift
to
tele
everything
will
be
extensive
and
that
will
diminish
in
person
contact
and
constrict
tech
usersâ
real
world
support
systems
and
their
social
connections


*
hopes
for
2025
â
social
justice
will
get
priority
the
reawakening
of
public
movements
for
social
justice
and
economic
equality
may
create
more
responsive
government
and
socio
political
systems
that
are
more
attuned
to
diversity
equity
and
inclusion


that
includes
focus
on
digital
divides


â
peopleâs
well
being
will
prevail
over
profit
businesses
may
start
to
value
serving
the
greater
good
above
the
typical
goals
of
market
capitalism


this
could
produce
policies
to
fund
broader
safety
nets
such
as
universal
health
care
universal
basic
income
and
broadband
as
a
basic
utility


a
reckoning
for
tech
companies
and
their
leaders
might
also
occur


â
the
quality
of
life
will
improve
the
transition
to
home
based
work
will
reduce
urban
air
pollution
overcrowding
and
transportation
gridlock
and
improve
quality
of
life
family
life
accommodations
for
disabilities
and
other
enhancements

artificial

the

three
choices
but
did

some
people
chose

of

following
are
the
longer
versions
of
responses
that
are
contained
in
shorter
form
in
one
or
more
places
the
survey
report


these
comments
were
collected
in
an
opt
in
invitation
to
more
than
10
000
people
that
asked
them
to
share
their
responses
to
a
web
based
questionnaire
in
july
2020


the
following
predictions
are
from
respondents
who
said
most
peopleâs
lives
will
be
mostly
worse
in
2025
than
they
were
prior
to
the
arrival
of
the
pandemic
a
telecommunications
and
internet
industry
economist
architect
and
consultant
with
over
25
years
of
experience
now
working
as
a
researcher
at
one
of
the
worldâs
foremost
technological
universities
responded
âthings
in
2025
will
be
mostly
worse
for
most
people
because
of
the
economic
downturn
associated
with
responding
to
the
crisis
which
was
aggravated
in
the
case
of
the
u

s


by
a
leadership
failure
that
has
made
covid
19
worse
and
consequently
made
the
associated
economic
downturn
worse


this
is
a
global
phenomenon
that
has
reversed
and
substantially
set
back
global
efforts
to
address
income
inequality
and
a
host
of
other
problems
that
we
were
not
addressing
adequately
in
any
case


the
impacts
of
covid
19
health
wise
and
economically
are
regressive
and
i
doubt
we
will
have
the
political
will
to
really
address
those
challenges
head
on


in
the
u

s


the
picture
is
likely
to
be
better
since
the
failure
in
leadership
we
have
experienced
under
trump
will
hopefully
be
reversed
and
a
number
of
other
issues
may
also
see
a
brighter
side
such
as
awareness
of
and
possible
partial
solutions
to
climate
change
and
preparation
for
the
next
covid
19
like
pandemic
which
had
been
anticipated
before
but
not
taken
seriously
â
our
preparedness
for
the
next
one
is
likely
to
be
better



through
all
of
this
the
role
of
digital
technologies
in
enabling
remote
social
and
economic
activity
has
been
critical
and
has
prevented
the
problem
from
being
even
worse


the
new
normal
will
include
much
greater
acceptance
of
remote
work
and
telecommuting
â
in
both
cases
things
that
were
happening
and
needed
to
happen
but
which
have
experienced
a
step
function
enhancement


this
will
provide
an
opportunity
to
address
climate
change
issues
and
possibly
encourage
better
commuting
practices


the
movement
away
from
urbanization
toward
suburbanization
and
the
adverse
impact
on
public
transport
systems
are
both
on
the
negative
side


i
think
we
will
see
a
step
increase
in
cybersecurity
threats
â
the
expansion
in
attack
surfaces
because
more
folks
are
online
is
a
sufficient
reason
for
that
â
and
the
concurrent
increase
in
risks
to
personal
liberty
of
surveillance
society


we
need
to
be
clear
on
what
we
want
in
our
society
but
stopping
it
is
unlikely
to
be
feasible
in
my
view


i
think
more
people
will
have
more
complicated
relationships
and
understanding
of
digital
technologies


our
dependency
and
social
fluency
with
using
it
will
be
greatly
advanced
e

g


everyone
now
knows
how
to
use
facebook
and
zoom
but
folks
will
not
wholly
appreciate
the
new
technologies
and
will
not
like
the
threats
to
privacy
and
cybersecurity
and
the
political
disruption
of
phenomena
like
âfake
news
â
which
are
greatly
and
inexorably
amplified
by
the
dark
side
of
social
media


in
giving
voice
to
all
and
in
enabling
the
viral
spread
of
that
voice
the
internet
and
digital
technologies
have
overridden
more
normal
social
and
economic
defense
mechanisms
against
the
destructive
power
of
fear
and
hatemongering
speech
â
it
is
too
attractive
as
a
consumption
good
for
people
to
simply
turn
away
and
too
powerful
as
a
mode
of
expression
to
expect
the
perpetrators
to
simply
disappear


unfortunately
there
are
no
silver
bullet
solutions


also
as
a
complementary
effect
the
boost
to
digitalization
will
accelerate
other
trends
although
the
adverse
macroeconomic
effects
provide
an
offsetting
dampening
effect
such
as
the
trend
towards
adoption
of
ai
and
other
automation
technologies
that
will
involve
a
lot
of
capital
substituting
for
labor
so
a
lot
of
disruption
in
employment
markets
that
will
not
be
limited
to
low
skilled
workers


lots
of
other
âwhite
collarâ
trades
will
be
ripe
for
offshoring
and
automation
like
lots
of
legal
work


in
the
short
medium
term
i
expect
this
to
have
significant
disruptive
effects
requiring
workers
across
the
economy
to
re
train
and
be
more
flexible
and
adaptive


the
over
hang
of
covid
19
related
debt
grotesquely
amplified
by
bad
fiscal
policies
since
2016
will
make
it
difficult
to
raise
the
funds
for
subsidy
programs
to
aging
populations
and
the
pension
fund
risk
is
significant
and
could
herald
a
global
economic
crisis
that
might
make
2008
look
like
childâs
play


strong
leadership
and
a
commitment
to
something
like
addressing
climate
change
and
rebuilding
our
infrastructure
and
economy
to
support
that
direction
might
offer
a
path
out
of
it
but
i
despair
of
that
sort
of
leadership
really
being
able
to
be
successful
in
the
u

s


or
globally

â
hopes
â1
telecommuting
â
it
expands
accessibility
enables
flexibility
and
reduces
greenhouse

smart
â
especially
smart
energy
systems
â
these
are
not
feasible
without
icts
and
digitalization
is
a
necessary
but
not
sufficient
solution
to
address


there
is
huge
potential
for
ict
augmented
productivity
and
efficiency
improvements
across
all
sectors
from
healthcare
to
finance
to
manufacturing
to
education


of
course
realizing
these
benefits
is
not
automatic
requires
co
evolution
of
âanalogâ
policies
and
will
need
to
confront
adverse
trends
that
digitalization
can
also
bring
so
realizing
this
potential
will
not
be
easy

â
worries
âthreats
to
income
inequality
privacy
and
security
and
fragmentation
and
disruption
of
sound
political
discourse


the

a
more

putting
those
together
is
hard


digital
technology
is
essential
to
support
the
multistakeholder
types
of
governance
solutions
we
need
but
it
is
also
very
effective
in
implementing
authoritarian
solutions
and
in
mobilizing
ignorance
and
mob

it
will
be
a
battle
to
see
whether
our
better
halves
can
succeed

â
a
research
professor
of
international
affairs
said
âsurveillance
capitalism
is
equivalent
to
government

a

we
may
be

faster


artificial

cars
will
continue

our

will
âbiteâ
us


some
of
our

may
become
easier
to

others
will
lag


this
is
partly
due
to
the
incompetence
if

lack
of

for

of
the
various

i
use
some
have
easy

some
are
hopeless


customer
care
from

a
bad

angering
joke


globalization
sometimes
provides
worse
services


my
internet
provider
comcast
is
highly
unreliable

seems
uninterested
in
providing
more
robust

technology
does
not
increase

greed

that
which
makes
companies
the
most
money
will
prevail


overall
high
tech
seems
to
increase
a
coarsening
of

encourage
social
isolation


some
young
white
men
will
continue
to
self
radicalize
over
the

progress
in

is
not
matched
by
progress
in

infrastructure


for
example
gun
control
in
the
u

lags
greatly


in
general
companies
do
not
care
about

lives


they
care
about
what
they
can
sell


for
some
companies
like
amazon
this
makes
for
a
very
good
user
experience


in

the
companies
are

neutral


they
will

manipulate
our
personal

surveillance
by
governments
using

from
high

â

the

âthose

be
more
dependent
on

servers
will
have
less
power
in
their

with
their

be
more
vulnerable


served
parties
will
also
be
more
vulnerable
because
of
their
dependence
on
more
fragile
supply
chains
for

greater
economic

drive
down

foundation
while
increasing
tribalism

its
political
exploitation
create
a

be
both
a

through
state

corporate

will
manifest
higher

increasingly
economic

this
will
be
sorely
tested
by
further
evidence
of
a
destructive
hostility
to

by
ingrained

for
a
model
of
this
trend
consider
the
behavior

the
assad

saudi
regimes
in
the
middle
east

the

the
manager
of
a
project
focused
on
enhancing
digital
life
said
âthe
nature
of
the
ânew
normalâ
will
likely
depend
very
much
on
socio
economic
status
geographic
location
and
nature
of
employment
prior
to
the
pandemic


i
therefore
donât
think
it
makes
much
sense
to
discuss
what
it
will
mean
for
the
âaverageâ
person
unless
a
working
definition
of
that
term
is
in
place


except
for
the
independently
wealthy
high
status
so
called
âwhite
collarâ
knowledge
workers
whose
day
to
day
lives
mostly
dealt
with
information
flows
i
think
that
for
the
most
part
people
will
be
worse
off
in
the
united
states
and
other
countries
that
have
failed
to
handle
their
response
to
the
pandemic
well


thereâs
simply
no
way
that
the
crushing
unemployment
racially
disparate
death
rates
economic
losses
and
educational
deterioration
in
these
nations
will
have
all
been
erased
in
four
or
five
years


barring
major
government
intervention
i
suspect
very
high
consistent
unemployment
at
capacity
healthcare
systems
and
dramatically
increased
social
stratification


i
predict
a
greater
economic
and
political
role
â
globally
â
for
countries
that
weather
the
pandemic
well
such
as
vietnam
taiwan
and
new
zealand


specifically
with
respect
to
digital
technology
for
those
with
adequate
bandwidth
as
of
now
quite
unevenly
distributed
remote
participation
in
work
and
in
general
will
be
much
more
common
perhaps
even
normative


there
will
be
less
business
travel
as
companies
will
have
been
forced
to
either
adapt
to
its
loss
or
will
have
realized
it
is
not
as
important
as
previously
thought


work
from
home
will
be
commonplace
for
those
who
can
do
so


i
hope
but
am
less
sanguine
that
necessarily
in
person
work
will
be
better
compensated
in
general


i
think
daily
routines
will
be
more
âbubbledâ
as
people
are
more
generally
mindful
of
their
contacts
and
exposure
and
there
will
be
a
greater
reliance
in
general
on
remote
connection
over
face
to
face
which
will
be
reserved
for
close
friends
and
family


i
expect
a
diversification
of
employment
to
remote
modalities
as
people
will
want
to
have
a
revenue
stream
that
is
less
contingent
on
physical
presence
which
will
lead
to
stratification
since
not
everyone
will
have
time
education
or
bandwidth
to
develop
alternate
jobs


being
able
to
âgo
digitalâ
will
be
much
more
critical
and
those
whose
jobs
must
be
in
person
will
be
far
more
vulnerable


privacy
could
go
two
ways


it
could
continue
to
erode
as
more
and
more
move
to
online
and
are
therefore

the
sweep

national
election

things
are
already
getting
pretty
ugly


this

seems
to
have
made
mistrust

more
of
a
problem
than
it
has
been

we
have
to
include
a
decline
in
trust

the
fact
that
more
and
more
of
the

the

i

marked
by
even

nothing

distant

hopes
âin
my
most
hopeful
moments
i
wish
for
the

worthy

we
would
have
to
place
in
them
for
us
to
rely
upon
the
advice
recommendations
warnings
and
guidance
about
the
choices
we
face
in
the
short
and
long
terms


these
trusted
systems
would
course
have
to
be
âsmart
â
but
they
would
also
have
to
have
developed
a
capacity
for
understanding
the
moral
and
ethical
systems
of
value
that
each
of
us
have
developed
or
are
developing
for
ourselves


these
systems
would
have
to
be
strictly
constrained
against
sharing
information
and
inferences
that
they
have
developed
in

to
serve
our

we
have
not

information
and
inferences
about
us
our

strengths
our
weaknesses

again
i
need
to
be
clear
here


we
will
continue

be
assessed

other
algorithmic

i
am
only
referring
to
those

with
which
we
establish
a
relationship

for
the
purpose
of
gaining
insights/guidance
about
how
we
should
proceed
toward
the

for
me
the
ideal
system
would
be
much
like

able
to
challenge
me
about

for

be
driven
out

earlier

of

there
will
be
more

even
more
greater
ageism
as
employers
realize

the

is
whether

will
get
the

to
get

â
for

as

â
to
allow
them
to
improve
their

the
problem
is
that
so
many
county

have
tremendous

cannot
improve

health

other
critically
important

teach
at
the

i
can
already
see
how

fall
behind

quickly


technology

telecommunications
companies
will
have
to
rethink
their
business
models
to
offer
greater
access
to
the
underserved
that
airlines
and
public
transportation
will
have
to
rethink
their

restaurants

will
have
to
focus
more
on

be
a
fun
diversion
for

it
will
be
a
vital
part
of
being
tied
to
work
24/7


people
will
give
up
any
privacy
to
stay
employed
because
employers
will
monitor
even
white
collar
professionals
at
all
times
and
professors
and
teachers
already
monitor
studentsâ
work
the
same
way


people
will
also
discover
they
can
find
exercise
teachers
â
if
they
are
motivated
â
online

may
find
it
is
less
stressful
than
being
in
a
crowded

a

i
donât
know
how
governments
will
deal
with
more
crowded
highways
if
people
continue
to
avoid
public
transportation


perhaps
more
individualized

will
get
underground

envisioned
in
âthe

â
speaking
of
âthe

perhaps

enough
to

that
we

while
the
pitches
to

and
2016
were
not
funded

time
such
a
solution
remains
viable

now
potentially
even
more
possible
to
start
in
the
next
two

five
years
given
advances

the
premise
of
such
a

centers
around
the
recognition
that
per
the
2001
anthrax
events
sars
h1n1
the
biggest
threat
of
biological
agents
is
the
protracted
time
window
it
takes
to
characterize
develop
treatment
and
perform
remediation


we
certainly
are
seeing
this
again
with
the
current

19
pandemic


exponentially
reducing
the
time
it
takes
to
mitigate
a
biothreat
agent
will
save

to
do
this
we
need
to
automate
detection
by
embedding

developing

that
take
humans
âout

worries
âback
in
2013
and
again
in
2016
a
proposal
informed
by
the
anthrax
events
of
2001
west
nile
virus
in
2002
and
both
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
sars
and
an
outbreak
of
monkeypox
in
the
united
states
in
2003
was
shared
with
the
defense
advanced
research
projects
agency
darpa



the
proposal
at
the
time
was
something
seen
as
a
safeguard
against
a
âlow
probability
high
consequenceâ
event
â
a
natural
or
human
caused
pandemic


the
solution
was
a
series
of
proposals
centered
around
the
concept
of
building
an
âimmune
system
for
the
planetâ
that
could
detect
a
novel
pathogen
in
the
air
water
or
soil
of
the
earth
and
rapidly
sequence
its
dna
or
rna


once
sequenced
high
performance
computers
would
strive
to
identify
both
the
three
dimensional
protein
surfaces
of
either
the
virus
or
bacteria
and
then
search
through
an
index
of
known
molecular
therapies
that
might
be
able
to
neutralize
the
pathogen


at
a
minimum
such
an
immune
system
for
the
planet
would
overcome
the
limits
of
waiting
for
nation
states
themselves
to
alert
the
international
community
of
outbreaks
within
their
borders


a
second
reason
also
was
associated
with
this
proposal
namely
exponential
changes
in
technology
and
create
pressures
for
representative
democracies
republics
and
other
forms
of
deliberative
governments
to
keep
up
â
both
at
home
and
abroad


in
an
era
in
which
precision
medicine
will
be
possible
so
too
will
be
precision
poison
tailored
and
at
a
distance


as
proposed
both
in
2013
and
again
in
2016
this
will
become
a
national
security
issue
if
we
donât
figure
out
how
to
better
use
technology
to
do
the
work
of
deliberative
governance
at
the
necessary
speed
needed
to
keep
up
with
threats
associated
with
pandemics

â
an
internet
pioneer
and
principal
architect
at
a
major
technology
company
said
âby
2025
the
economy
will
be
on
an
upward
trend
but
unemployment
and
gdp
will
still
not
have
returned
to
the
levels
of
february
2020


in
particular
the
banking
arts
retail
real
estate
and
travel/hospitality
sectors
will
not
have
recovered
completely
due
to
the
high
level
of
retail
bankruptcies
which
in
turn
led
to
a
real
estate
downturn
and
high
levels
of
loan
defaults
in
the
banking
sector


also
virus
vaccines
will
prove
only
partially
effective
with
new
strains
continually
evolving


so
pandemics
will
become
an
ongoing
problem
that
will
result
in
lower
levels
of
international
travel
and
trade


with
so
many
retail
businesses
shuttered
the
levels
of
online
purchases
will
have
soared


also
many
arts
groups
theatres
museums
will
have
been
forced
to
either
adapt
to
the
online
world
or
to
close


this
will
lead
to
virtual
museum
tours
and
exhibits
theatre
groups
with
seasons
produced
online
and
many
television
programs
produced
at
home


similarly
with
movie
theatres
having
declared
bankruptcy
new
movies
will
largely
be
released
on
streaming
services


remote
work
will
have
become
the
ânew
normal
â
leading
many
companies
to
reduce
their
real
estate
footprint


many
educational
institutions
will
have
moved
to
online
learning
as
their
principle
means
of
instruction


with
âwork
from
homeâ
as
the
new
normal
we
will
see
a
mass
migration
away
from
expensive
west
coast
cities
like
san
francisco
san
jose
seattle
and
los
angeles


some
will
move
to
nearby
less
expensive
areas
like
sacramento
gilroy
north
bend
or
palmdale


others
will
leave
those
states
for
nevada
arizona
new
mexico
or
oregon

â
hopes
âmuch
of
the
tech
innovation
occurring
today
is
driven
by
customers
adapting
to
the
ânew
normalâ
rather
than
from
product
developers


however
in
the
years
to
come
we
will
see
products
adapting
to
those
new
uses
of
the
technology


as
an
example
educational
institutions
have
rapidly
moved
to
online
learning
but
the
results
have
been
uninspiring
because
the
products
that
are
being
used
were
not
designed
for
online
learning
and
the
curriculum
has
not
been
honed
for
it


by
2025
many
of
the
kinks
will
have
been
worked
out
and
new
products
designed
from
the
ground
up
for
education
will
have
taken
root
delivering
much
better
results


similarly
by
2025
we
will
see
products
designed
to

despite
companies
playing

overall

but
a

be
harder
to
find


for
example
it
appears
that
many

never
reopen

will
eliminate
a

of
those

similarly
the

has
disrupted
education

the
effect
of

should
be
hitting
hard
in
five

i
doubt
that
air
travel
will
recover
even
in
five
years
putting
a
lot
of
people
in

out
of
jobs

will
in

result
in
reduced
factory
work
for
people

there

to
this

the
consolidation
of
many

the

they

before

a

even
if
we
shake

weâre
likely
to
find
ourselves
hamstrung
by

it

be
harder

privacy

be
under

intrusive

âjustifiedâ
on
the

â
hopes
âthe
main
benefit
has
been
the
realisation
that
people

not

â
they
can
do
much
at

this
will
potentially
allow
them
to
save

they
can
spend
more

âsee
previous
comment
about

a
journalism
professor
emeritus
said
âthe
new
normal
will
be
a
society
more
paranoid
about
casual
human
interactions
â
handshakes
hugs
and
sitting
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
strangers
in
theaters
restaurants

airplanes


shopping
malls
cruise
lines
hotels

shrivel

the
survivors

less
affordable
to
the

online
banking
online
shopping

telemedicine
videoconferencing
virtual
work
teams

working
from
home
would
likely
emerge
as
new
normals
at

in
western
societies


these
changes
may
have
dramatic
impacts
on
transportation

urban
life
in

and
they
could
result
in
fewer
people

it
necessary

it

be
naive

by

more
seriously

weâll
still
have
the
headwind
of
how
to
deal
with
the
economic

with
resistance
by
those
who
want
to
hang
on

the

how
or
if
weâre
able
to
deploy
new
digital

and
ai
to
create
opportunities
will
be
key
to
determining
if
we
have
a
viable
future
or
not


our
collective
interface
with
the
world
will
come
largely
via
mediation
rather
than
human
interaction


and
ai
will
play
an
ever
larger
role
in
that
mediation
as
it
finds
applications
for
routine
health

of

greater

of
cyber

threats
job
losses
for
millions

yet
what
seems
like
an
inevitable
march
toward

run
headlong
into
an

not

a
post

researcher
studying
the
relationship

observed
âthe

entrenches
existing

the
monopolization

revealing
these

exacerbating
the
precarity

it
is
possible
that
the

will
serve
as
a
catalyst
for
making
changes
necessary
to
improving
life
but
by
2025
it
seems
unlikely
that
so
many
changes
will
have
taken
place


still
there
are
hopeful
signs
in
the

the
rapid
shifting
of
overton
windows
on
many
topics
so
one
must
hold
out
hope
even
while
being
realistic


from
a
technology
perspective
the
rapid
shift
to
work
online
has
made
the
powerful
players
more
powerful
and
entrenched


much
of
technology
usage
depends
on
peopleâs
understanding
of
how
to
use
it
and
we
have
jumped
fully
into
the
deep
end
of
the
pool
well
before
having
learned
how
to
swim


for
example
life
for
many
people
now
revolves
around
online

how
to
integrate
such
conferencing
into
organizations
is
not
widely
understood


similarly
the
economic
conditions
resulting
from
the
pandemic
limit
the
capacity
for
small
business
to
fight
established
business
and
also
create
new
economic
imperatives
for
the
adoption
of
existing
technologies


together
these
forces
entrench
established
players
and
hurt
new
entrants
and
competitors


there
is
an
opportunity
to
counter
this
with
policy
though
it
is
being
squandered

â
hopes
âit
is
my
hope
that
we
can
find
ways

that
it
is
possible
to
use
information
technologies

it
is
not
at
all
clear
that
the
market
supports
such

to
attempt

i
worry

well

the
abuse

to
further
disintegrate

more

see
the
benefits
of
remote
working
cost
wise
which
may
reflect
both
as
positive

employers

more

slowly

the

at

in

become
ever
more
a
process

individualised
competition

opportunities
unless
significant
steps
can
be
taken
to
reassert
the
social

that
maybe
we
donât
need
to
eat
out
in

every

when
one
considers
the
consequences
of

learning

ultimately
the

of

long

hollow
out

economic

also
slip
away
from

become
cautious
about

covid
19
has
been
an
enabler
of
ageism

made

isolation
worse

âthe

more
expectations
about

erode

i

resources
for
students
who
do
not
have

meaningfully
changed


isolation

not

pandemic
expanded
peopleâs

doing
some

virtually

may
have
been
reluctant

remote

could
reduce
burdens

could
make
life
easier
for
people

economic

the

with
that

weâll
have

â
blending

cultural

âwhile
this

leading
to
an
acceptance

these
faulty
chains
of
logic
in
more

or
perhaps
it
is
just
becoming
more
obvious
that
this
is
happening



there
is
also
a
much
greater
acceptance
of
authority
even
when
the
authority
approves
of
mob
actions
which
is
from
the
outside
a
move
against
the

itself


maybe
people
should
wonder
if

against

are
approved
by
those

are
actually
against

are
moving
into
a
world
where
a
new
elite
the
3%
of
people
shouting
on
twitter
and
other
services
control
the
direction
and
agenda
of
nations


since
twitter
is
primarily
concerned
with
engagement
they
float
emotional
content
to
the
top
driving
the
move
towards
viewing
the
world
from
within
a
purely
emotional
bubble


itâs
a
very
worrying
development


post
covid
19
and
riots
people
will
be
constantly
worried
about
losing
their
livelihoods
and
families
which
is
going
to
have
a
major
impact
of
family
and
business
formation


people
are
going
to
trust
government
officials
less


i
can
only
hope
people
view
technology
in
particular
anything
based
on
neurodigital
media
such
as
social
media
with
a
great
deal
more
suspicion


i
fear
however
that
we
are
far
too
dependent
on
these
technologies
to
make
any
real
changes
here
even
though
we
may
be
starting
to
mistrust
them


people
will
continue
to
use
these
technologies
en
masse
and
with
little
thought
for
what
that
use
does


one
interesting
trend
iâm
starting
to
see
is
that
some
younger
folks
have
stopped
putting
their
lives
online
â
becoming
lurkers
rather
than
performers
all
the
time


this
is
a
healthy
change
if
it
takes
hold

â
hopes
âi
hope
technology
makes
it
possible
for

to
come
together

they
are
geographically

in
the
realm
of
spreading
truth

the
ability
of

to
live
longer

towards

â
in
reference
to
the
tendency
even
before
the
pandemic
for
people
to
text
instead
of

so
while
the
ability
to
reach
out
using
technology
is
a
positive
outcome
the
impulse
to
reach
out
may
be
stifled
as
well


technology
can
help
overcome
social
isolation
and
therefore
improve
well
being
and
it
can
also
exacerbate
isolation
and
distort
the
ability
to
make
connections


not
all
employment
can
be
done
online
but
for
those
jobs
that
are
enhanced
or
enabled
by
technology
the
flexibility
of
the
ability
to
work
from
anywhere
will
lead
to
the
expectation
that
we
will
work
from
anywhere
and
at
any

bleeding
work
into
all
aspects
of
our

technology
may
create
new

only
for
those
with
the
requisite
skills


others
will
see
an
erosion
of
economic
security
as
the
disruption
of
the

damages
their

a

of

responded
âit
will
be
a
mixed
bag
âsome
things
will
be
better

some
things
will
be
worse


for
example
some
people
may
find
freedom
in
the
technologies
that
enable
them
to
work
remotely
and
perhaps
some
companies
will
more
readily
embrace
such
arrangements


on
the
other
hand
the
pandemicâs
push
towards
remote
working
arrangements
also
seems
to
further
erode
the
work
life
dichotomy
which
has
been
steadily
weakening
since
the
blackberry
and
web
based
email
were
introduced


people
may
mind
that
they
are
even
more
so
âalways
onâ
because
they
never
truly
leave
the
office


we
also
need
to
acknowledge
that
whether
a
working
from
home
arrangement
is
welcome
or
not
it
likely
brings
with
it
some
complicated
questions
about
privacy
in
the
workplace


is
it
acceptable
for
employers
to
monitor
employees
working
remotely


how
will
workplace
norms
shift
with
respect
to
personal
privacy


what
types
of
collisions
might
we
anticipate
as
work
and
personal
life
is
commingled
or
will
there
be
ways
to
erect
firewalls
between
the
two


then
there
are
the
security
challenges
that
come
with
this
new
digital
environment


in
pushing
a
workforce
remote
the
normal
threat
surface
grows
exponentially
as
work
and
home
environments
merge


adding
complexity
and
connectivity
of
this
sort
has
generally
led
to
less
security
not
more


we
might
as
well
anticipate
that
our
home
networks
will
now
become
more
appealing
targets
to
those
looking
to
find
ways
into
employersâ
networks

we
ought
to
expect
some
collateral
damage
in
the
process

worries
âin
the
1990s
congress
consciously
considered
whether
and
how
they
might
regulate
internet

problems
like
privacy

protection


they
ultimately
demurred
on
this
question
reasoning
that
the
private
sector
would
know
better
than
the
government
how
to
respond
to
these
issues
as
they
arise


privacy
on
the
internet
has
largely
been
self
regulated
in
this
way
for
the
better
part
of
three
decades
and
itâs
only
become
more
obvious
over
time
that
letting
this
remain
an
ungoverned
territory
is
not
wise


yet
the
future
is
likely
to
bring
with
it
ways
to
interact
with
each
other
online
and
thus
more
intermediaries
and
opportunities
for
companies
to
be
in
positions
with
access
to
individualsâ
digital
existences


most
concerning
is
that
we
donât
have
great
solutions
for
how
we
should
govern
privacy
despite
having
the
benefit
of
several
decadesâ
worth
of
debate
about
it


laws
like
europeâs
gdpr
provide
at
best
an
incremental
improvement
over
the
status
quo
while
competitively
disadvantaging
small
and
mid
size
companies

a
distinguished

balance
between
state
interests
and
corporate
profits
on
the
one
hand
and
human
rights
on
the
other
hand
is
also
deteriorating
fairly
rapidly
with
only
a
few
signs
of
improvement

people
will
likely
continue
to
use
technology
that
pervasively
gathers
very
intimate
information
on
them
and
shares
that
both
with
companies
most
of
which
for
most
people
will
be
foreign
firms
not
subject
to
any
realistic
potential
for
oversight
or
regulation
by
their
own
government
even
if
that
government
is
democratic
and
with
the
state
which
may
well
pose
a
serious
threat
to
the
individualâs
personal
safety
and
security


automation
and
artificial
intelligence
will
continue
to
disrupt
employment
opportunities
and
earning
power
at
the
same
time
as
states
face
diminished
capacity
both
from
broad
economic
trends
and
from
the
current
pandemic


so
people
facing
reduced
economic
circumstances
will
have
little
realistic
prospect
of
meaningful
public
assistance

â
hopes
âthe
hope
shouldnât
be
placed
in
technology
but
rather
in
the
governance
of
that
technology


for
meaningful
effective
governance
to
take
place
for
global
technologies
however
the
governance
needs
to
be
above
the
level
of
the
nation
state
at
least
in
important
part


that
demands
a
capacity
for
international
cooperation
and
coordination
that
we
have
seen
little
sign
of
outside
the
limited
example
of
the
european
union
which
is
also
under
considerable
political
strain


put
simply
there
isnât
much
of
a
realistic
basis
to
believe
things
will
get
better
in
the
foreseeable
future

â
worries
âthe
stark
imbalance
of
power
the
limited
understanding
most
people
have
of
the
technology
and
crucially
of
its
social
effects
and
the
difficulty
of
providing
nation
state
level
governance
of
a
distributed
set
of
global
technologies

â
a
professor
of
mathematics
and
computer
science
commented
âi
fear
covid
19
will
still
be
with

social
distancing
will
be

jobs
and

will
be

as
much
as
possible
not
onsite


people
wonât
physically
interact
with

a
professor
of

is
expert
in
how
people
learn
new
information
both
true
and
false
predicted
âthe
ânew
normalâ
will
involve
more
remote
work
opportunities


as
companies
figure
out
the
benefits
and
drawbacks
to
working
from
home
i
think
more
will
decide
to
keep
employees
remote
or
to
drastically
increase
the
amount
of
time
spent
working
remotely


this
on
the
whole
will
likely
lead
to
benefits
for
both
employees
and
employers


the
reason
i
think
things
will
be
worse
in
2025
is
because
of
the
large
inequities
in
education


with
schools
closed
middle
class
and
above
parents
will
seek
out
individualistic
solutions
that
allow
their
children
to
continue
their
education


however
other
students
will
be
left
behind
and
as
wealthy
parents
continue
to
leave
the
public
schools
the
schools
will
become
even
more
underfunded
and
under
resourced


iâm
very
worried
that
this
will
lead
to
the
end
of
publicly
funded
k
12
schooling
as
we
know
it


the
lack
of
publicly
funded
in
person
preschool
and
elementary
school
will
lead
to
large
gender
inequities
with
many
moms
either
moving
to
part
time
or
quitting
in
order
to
provide
childcare


even
when
in
person
school
does
restart
the
interruption
to
parentsâ
careers
will
be
felt
for
years


virtual
conferences
will
become
a
new
normal
with
most
conferences
offering
both
in
person
and
online
activities


the
online
sessions
will
be
appealing
to
those
who
are
unwilling
or
unable
to
travel
due
to
caregiving
responsibilities
climate
change
concerns
cost

we

we

so
a

in

the

shift
a

in
the
best

we
will
reconfigure
our

allow
for
more
decentralized

the
potential
to
transition

massive

i
believe
the

going
to
drive
the

so
this

will
have
changed
the
most
is
our
sense
of
being
a
part

greater
than

the

reminds
us
that

those
far
away

those
whom
we

100

i
think
global

will
become
the
ânew

in

â
who
resist

at
all

who
resist
cooperation

still

constant
challenge
to
every
bit

good

bad
in

years

perhaps
even
on
a
level
that
involves
violence


as
far
as
technology
is
concerned
i
think
the
new

will
include
a
better
understanding
of

strategies
for
dealing
with
the
isolation
and
vulnerability
of
elders

those
living

via

i
think
we
will
also
see
an
advancement
in

encouragement
to
explore
the

way

alternatives
for
those
who
canât
travel
for
education
and
for
those
locked
out
of
attendance
because
of
the
capping
of
crowds


i
think
weâll
see
an
even
greater
push
for
access
to
healthcare
perhaps
an
understanding
that
health
care
costs
can
be
out
of
reach
even
for
our
doctors
and
nurses


there
will
be
a
growing
focus
on
the
healthcare
needs
of
families
dealing
with
age
related
dementia
which
will
bring
an
even
greater
focus
on
all
aspects
of
mental
health
care
and
the
burden
to
which
families
and
women
supplement
healthcare
for
the
elderly


i
believe
we
might
find
ourselves
doing
a
fair
bit
more
of
community
and
social
sharing
and
trading
via
technology
as
the
requisite
part
of
being
in
a
community


for
example
the
sharing
of
talent
to
help
parents
entertain
and
educate
children
when
needed


weâll
also
see
a
greater
intrusion
of
technology
into
our
private
lives
as
not
everyone
has
a
way
to
stage
where

engage
in

it
can
be

to
get
anything
more

zooming

this
can
have
enormous

it
comes
to

it
also
limits
us

an
assistant

university
said
âtechnology
will
be
used
even
more
to
automate
routine
and
boring
aspects

the
more
interesting
and
complex
processes
to
humans


technology

the

will
be
quietly
reformed

largely
outside

glare


public
service
will
become
a
trendy
thing
for
young

people
will
learn
to
find
social
solidarity
and
meaning
offline
as
the
failure
to
successfully
combat

online
causes
people
to
view
online

with
new
skepticism


thatâs
the
good
side


on
the
downside
we
will
continue
to
fight
an
escalation
in
white
nationalism
which
likely
will
include
violence

i
donât
expect
major

âi

i
also
worry
that

have
made

simplistic
intolerant

unkind


social

the
habits

have
eroded
the
basic
civic
virtues
necessary
to
a
healthy
and
inclusive
democracy

â
the
director
of
an
innovation
lab
responded
âthe
pandemic
has
accelerated
change
by
increasing
the
breadth
of

moving
to
a
critical

broader
scope

where
this
leads
us

up

up
to
us

sense
â
with
no
guaranteed
progress

most
likely
some
of
each


as
we
live
more
digitally
i
hope
we
adjust
in
ways
that
foreground
equity
and
incorporate
the
movement
against
systemic
racism
and
exclusion


this
could
lead
to
expanded
technology
access
treating
broadband
as
a
utility
making
it
not
just
affordably
available
to
all
households
but
a
default
like
water
and
electricity
for
example



we
might
also
become
more
aware
of
â
and
engaged
with
â
the
surveillance
economy
taking
a
variety
of
steps
to
address
the
way
our
privacy
is
protected
our

is
used
responsibly

so
on


more
broadly
this
invokes
a
series
of
changes
at
key
institutions
from
tech
companies
to
journalism
and
higher
education
ranging
from
diversity
and
inclusion
to
reconsidering
how
they
meaningfully
contribute
socially


the
best
outcome
would
be
not
a
gradual
shift
in
these
directions
but
a
collective
realization
that
we
need
to
respond
to
our
increased
reliance
on
technology
for
work
study
play
health
and
everything
else
with
a
robust
public
health
and
environmentally
oriented
set
of
policy
interventions


done
well
this
could
lead
to
improved
access
to
services
better
defaults
and
more
control
over
your
personal
data
services
and
technologies
that
are
designed
for
equity
and
inclusion
and
a
more
complementary
relationship
between
on
and
offline
lives


then
again
we
could
really
screw
it
up
do
nothing
substantial
exacerbate
existing
gaps
and
promote
more
social
and
political
polarization


itâs
our
call

an

âtechnology

be
a

good

therefore
more

aphorism
â
more
than

listen
to
digital

provide

engagement
leveraging
human

to
make

allowing

be
preferred

the
blur
of
work

non

times
moving
ever
more
away
from
the
idea
of

will
lead
to
a
new
set

this
will
be
aided
by
shared
workspaces

things


facebook

the
best
example
â
a
horribly
intrusive/manipulative
system

being
recognized
more
broadly
these

mostly
because
of
the
stress

the

going
to
have
a
lot
less

on

after

up
on
such

the

pre

e

g


europe

in
contrast
those
countries
with
very

may

tighten
their

need
for

to
achieve
success
e

g


masks

socializing
constraints
require
at

no

probably
the

so
the
ânew

should
be
improved
for
current
democracies
during
and
after
a
transition
period
that
might
still
be
underway
in
2025

likely
worse

other
countries

my
second
main
worry

the

potential
scenario
âin

the
response
to
the
covid

has
disrupted
the
status

way
of
doing
things

forced
people
to
find
new
ways
to
function
under
quarantine
and
social
distancing


key
among
those
changes
are
widescale
adoption
of
work
at
home
across
a
broad
range
of
job
functions

industries


workers
are
able
to
eliminate
daily
commuting
gaining
back
time
in
their
days
and
reducing
costs
associated
with
drive/public
transportation
to
get
to
work


living
close
to
the
office
is
no
longer
necessary
so
workers
moved
out
of
cities
to
more
remote
suburbs
where
they
could
have
more
space
for
the
same
or
lower
price
as
their

companies
need

to
support
operations
and
place
more
focus
on
using
company
owned
space
for
functions
that
require
in

needless
to
say
this
has
had
significant
impacts
on
property

cities
saw
declines

both

saw
growth


broadband

a
necessity

actions
have
been
taken
to
close
the
remaining
broadband
gaps
rural
deployment
and
low
income
adoption



education
delivery
k

secondary
have
been
dramatically
transformed

school
systems

colleges
learned
how
to
effectively
use
technologies

a

and
founder
of
an
agency
helping

responded
âfrom
the
standpoint
of
community
covid
19
has
put
a
spotlight
on
those
who
are
not
typically
included


we
live
with
a
misconception
that
âin
real
lifeâ
or
âface
to
faceâ
is
the
best
option
and
the
most
representative
one


this
is
often
a
racist
and
ableist
viewpoint
in
my
opinion


the
reality
is
that
there
are
huge
swaths
of
our
society
who
are
unable
or
uncomfortable
with
irl
situations
and
thereby
typically
excluded
â
yet
we
donât
notice


for
example
people
living
with
a
disability
whether
physical
or
who
are
neurodiverse
parents
especially
women
of
small
children
and
bipoc


moving
gatherings
and
work
online
has
enabled
people
not
typically
included
to
both
be
more
included
and/or
remove
themselves
from
the
challenges
and
micro
aggressions
that
are
forced
from
irl
cultures


some
examples

the

people
are
getting
sober
through

you
will
need
to
substantiate
this
as
i
have
heard
it
secondhand
but
as
a
seattle
local
i
have
heard
that
amazon
surveyed
its
employees
regarding
preferences
for
working
from
home
and
that
black
women
had
the
highest
preference


ask
them
about
this


itâs
important


3
the
disability
community
has
been
asking
for
accommodations
at
work
such
as
flexible
schedules
and
working
remotely
for
years


they
are
now
receiving
them
in
part
because
everyone
is
receiving
them


my
hope
is
that
when
we
do
return
to
more
âin
personâ
activities
we
will
be
more
inclusive
and
that
more
online
options
will
available
â
from
working
remotely
to
more
permanent
online
community
events


many
of
the
misconceptions
about
online
interactions
being
inferior
to
in
person
have
been
tested
and
i
think
we
will
see
that
many
of
those
misconceptions
will
not
hold
up


while
i
am
not
typically
concerned
about
privacy
i
do
worry
about
safeguards
when
it
comes
to
technology
like
facial
recognition
specifically
when
it
is
being
used
against
disenfranchised
communities
or
those
questioning
the
status
quo
such
as
protestors

â
a
computer
engineer
replied
âit
will
be
better
in
some
ways
and
worse
in
other
ways


folks
now
realize
the
importance
of
family
of
rest
of
connection
with
other
people
in
a
way
that
was
not
possible
before
the
pandemic


i
would
hope
that
they
will
not
allow
industry
to
take
that
away
from
them
especially
since
many
will
have
accumulated
debts


hopefully
the
cost
of
education
will
go
be
reduced
thanks
to
online
classes
making
it
more
affordable
for
a
larger
part
of
the
population


in
the
move
to
digital
i
have
been
on
more
zoom
calls
with
family
and
friends
than
i
ever
imagined


this
has
led
to
connections
with
people
who
live
farther
away
and
to
a
new
comfort
level
with
the
technology


this
opens
the
door
to
remote
collaboration
and
access
to
people
and
resources
that
were
previously
not
considered
possible
or
normal


the
presence
of
technology
in
daily
life
is
making
the
country
and
the
world
a
smaller
place


this
could
have
the
negative
effect
of
isolating
people
from
their
immediate
surroundings
neighbors
co
workers
etc


more
than
before
the
pandemic


it
depends
on
each
personâs
choice


having
more
neighbors
work
from
home
has
given
me
more
opportunities
to
see
and
greet
my
neighbors
some
of
whom
i
never
knew
existed


i
work
remotely
and
have
for
over
a
year


hopefully
more
people
will
regularly
work
from
home
this
is
good
for
the
environment
less
traffic
and
a
reduction
in
the
need
to
do
fracking
to
get
every
last
ounce
of
gas/oil


hopefully
people
will
become
more
comfortable
on
video
calls
though


it
is
frustrating
to
have
a
call
with
your
team
and
only
one
person
has
the
camera
on


the
technology
will
be
good
for
the
aging
population
who
has
now
learned
to
operate
and
connect
via
video


privacy
is
something
americans
often
overlook
in
the
tradeoff
with
convenience


my
health
insurer
offers
telemedicine
any
time
without
a
co
pay


i
have
not
been
to
a
doctor
in
over
a
year


this
will
become
more
and
more
prevalent

âthe

may
be
the
tipping
point

have
health
implications
lasting
into
the
second
half
of
the
21st
century
with
regards
to
lasting
heart
and
lung
damage


the
racial
unrest
demonstrated
during
the
pandemic
may
also
translate
into
a
redistribution
of
public

programs
being
better
equipped
financially
to
lessen
police

in
these

they
are
ill

i
think
2025
will
see
more
people
doing
work
remotely


i
also
think
that
there
will
be
a
greater
push
towards
the
realization
that
broadband
internet
should
be
treated
as
a
utility
or
a
right
in
order
to
address
inequities
in
remote
instruction
for
students
of
all
ages
and
teleworkers
during
the
pandemic


these
changes
to
healthcare
and
access
to
overcoming
practical
barriers
to
telework
in
rural
areas
or
for
lower
income
peoples
can
drive
a
renewed
existence
of
small
business

this
will
be
pushing
against
the
collapse
of
many
small
businesses
due
to
the
pandemic
in
the
course
of
the
next
two
to
three
years


this
might
enable
the
âgig
economyâ
to
persist
allowing
such
jobs
to
be
done
while
giving
the
workers
a
social
safety
net
that
they
donât
currently
have


some
ideas
about
day
to
day
chores
and
activities
that
might
change
grocery
delivery
or
quick
pickup
will
become
more
standardized


restaurant
orders
increasingly
rely
on
delivery

takeout
options
which
could
drive
the
development

automated

traditional

institutions

better
incorporate
lessons
from

online
learning

1
address
challenges
to
remote

2
better
incorporate

âbetter
preparation
for
the

improved

indigenous

that
are
in
danger
of
dying
out
in

improvements

transform

change
in
itself
the
better

of
the

act

improved

the

a

said
ânot
thinking
primarily
or
in
depth
about
digital
technology
i
think
things
might
be
better
in
2025


we
will
be
used
to
wearing
masks
and
will
wear
them
in
public
during
flu
season
and
our
health
will
improve
overall
as
a
result


i
think
during
the
pandemic
we
have
laid
the
groundwork
for
some
sort
of
universal
basic
income
whether
that
comes
in
the
form
of
direct
money
tax
policy
or
both
and
that
it
will
no
longer
be
defensible
to
shut
gig
workers
out
of
employment


one
of
the
most
revolutionary
things
that
has
come
out
of
the
pandemic
is
here
to
stay
education
entertainment
and
interaction
on
your
screen
on
demand


the
normalization
of
being
able
to
get
what
you
need
and
want
without
having
to
travel
a
great
distance
or
pay
an
exorbitant
amount
of
money
will
be
an
incredible
boon
to
society


however
this
will
come
at
a
cost


we
will
be
tracked


we
already
are
and
have
been
for
a
long
time
but
there
will
no
longer
be
a
fight
against
it


our
digital
profile
will
be
like
our
social
security
number
â
something
required
by
the
government
for
the
public
good
but
also
used
often
to
exploit
people


and
while
itâs
amazing
to
be
able
to
get
what
you
need
without
leaving
the
house
or
necessarily
working
for
it
that
doesnât
mean
itâs
the
healthiest
choice
to
make
consistently
and
iâm
concerned
about
what
widespread
implementation
of
virtual
contact
would
mean
particularly
for
education


there
is
no
replacing
the
social
bonds
that
form
on
campus
and
it
would
be
psychologically
disastrous
for
colleges
to
close
and
be
replaced
by
zoom
meetings


also
many
people
record
onscreen
meetings
by
default


on
the
one
hand
itâs
great
to
have
a
record
of
that
time
the
teacher
sexted
in
your
class


on
the
other
it
tamps
down
your
bravery
and
spontaneous
free
inquiry
to
know
that
you
are
being
recorded
while
you
speak


there
is
a
theory
that
some
young
white
males
have
been
living
this
life
for
a
while


unemployed
subsisting
off
of
an
income
they
didnât
personally
earn
for
instance
living
with
parents
and
living
their
entire
life
through
screens
video
games
reddit
etc





the
theory
maintains
that
this
class
of
people
is
resentful
and
unfulfilled


if
all
of
society
lives
this
way
weâll
be
more
prone
as
a
whole
to
the
problems
associated
with
this
demographic


in
order
for
america
not
to
collapse
weâll
need
the
ânew
normalâ
to
be
one
option
not
the
only
option

an
anonymous

âwork

this
will

in

â
more

more

will
lead
to
more

if

an
anonymous
respondent
commented
âitâs
very
difficult
to
predict
what
the
world
will
look
like
in
2025
in
no
small
part
because
we
know
so
little
about
the
virus
and
therefore
canât
meaningfully
model
what
additional
system
shocks
we
are
likely
to
endure
from
it


if
it
becomes
endemic
and
recurs
in
a
widespread
way
such
that
most
of
the
population
eventually
becomes
infected
if
it
reinfects
easily
and
is
more
severe
on
reinfection
and
if
it
catalyzes
chronic
health
problems
in
those
infected
are
all
huge
unanswered
questions


equally
uncertain
is
whether
the
response
we
currently
have
to
the
pandemic
remains
stable


already
in
the
united
states
we
have
two
narratives
of
community
pandemic
response


in
the
first
people
came
together
in
unprecedented
solidarity
to
give
authorities
time
to
implement
the
testing
tracing
isolation
and
other
protocols
necessary
to
live
with
the
virus
in
a
controlled
way


this
was
successful
in
slowing
the
spread
of
infection
and
may
have
resulted
in
containment
if
it
had
been
maintained
and
supplemented
with
effective
coordinated
governmental
response


it
was
not
however
and
as
we
see
a
resumption
of
exponential
growth
in
cases
we
are
seeing
less
solidarity
and
more
confusion
frustration
and
nihilism
responses
that
are
likely
to
be
much
less
effective


it
is
tempting
to
suggest
that
as
new
outbreaks
occur
elsewhere
in
the
world
as
they
must
and
as
the
conditions
of
pandemic
wear
on
that
others
will
not
let
frustration
overcome
discipline
and
begin
to
create
false
and
destructive
narratives
around
the
disease
centered
for
example
on
xenophobia
rather
than
collective
action


all
that
said
this
crisis
for
all
its
devastation
has
forced
human
societies
into
natural
experiments
that
would
have
been
unthinkable
before
the
pandemic
for
good
and
bad
reasons


these
experiments
regardless
of
their
motivation
have
given
us
insights
into
our
society
that
we
havenât
had
and
forced
us
to
confront
implications
that
we
were
avoiding


we
see
fault
lines
in
our
society
better
than
we
ever
have
and
more
people
than
ever
understand
them
as
what
they
are
â
existential
problems
that
canât
be
ignored


we
also
see
in
its
omission
how
important
the
role
of
good
central
governance
is
to
maintaining
and
improving
our
society
and
how
important
it
is
to
hold
those
who
are
invested
with
power
in
our
society
accountable
to
those
whom
society
rightly
serves


on
a
smaller
scale
the
pandemic
has
shown
us
the
tremendous
value
telecommunications
has
in
our
lives
both
in
staying
in
touch
with
each
other
and
in
enabling
commerce


it
has
demonstrated
that
we
need
physical
co
location
much
less
than
we
thought
diminishing
the
importance
of
both
geography
and
physical
ability
to
enterprise
hiring
and
making
it
easier
than
ever
to
bring
more
diverse
voices
into
the
enterprise
just
as
we
are
starting
to
truly
appreciate
the
need
for
such
diversity


discussions
surrounding
diversity
and
equity
have
caused
us
to
reevaluate
the
pervasive
use
of
machine
learning
and
big
data
acquisition
and
analysis
with
an
eye
again
toward
diversity
and
community


combined
with
a
new
appreciation
for
the
role
of
government
in
ensuring
a
just
and
safe
society
i
expect
the
field
to
become
more
heavily
scrutinized
both
by
those
outside
the
big
data
community
and
by
its
own
practitioners


this
trend
is
already
happening
along
with
a
rising
consciousness
among
those
practitioners
that
they
have
an
ethical
responsibility
independent
of
that
of
their
employers
and
a
moral
responsibility
to
oppose
them
if
they
believe
they
are
acting
against
the
public
interest


the
net
effect
is
a
society
coming
to
truly
appreciate
how
it
is
broken
how
broken
it
is
and
taking
responsibility
for
fixing
it


if
these
trends
continue
and
absent
more

see

we
will
see
the
personalization

my

that

more
walled
behind
our
technology
and
grow
unable
to
empathize
read
social
cues
and
evolve
as
human

personal
growth
typically
comes
from

cyberstalking


the
use

by

to
make
people
frightened


and
cyber
censorship
â
the
use
of
technology
to
enforce
politically
correct
speech
and
ban
people
from
online
spaces

â
a
researcher
focused
on
the
evolution
of
digital
and
political
communication
noted
âthe
ânew
normalâ
will
highly
depend
on
political
leadership
and
each
countryâs
commitment
to
liberal
democracy


assuming
that
political
leadership
is
based
on
evidence
based
decision
making
the
ânew
normalâ
for
the
average
person
will
consist
most
likely
out
of
a
more
robust
healthcare
system
as
well
as
a
social
security
net


healthcare
would
not
be
bound
to
employment
and
unemployment
would
be
bolstered
by
a
robust
social
security
system
that
is
built
around
the
understanding
that
losing
a
job
can
affect
everyone
and
is
not
centered
around
someoneâs
skills


as
additional
wish
i
would
hope
for
societyâs
understanding
that
the
jobs
that
are
now
seen
as
âessentialâ
will
also
get
treated
and
rewarded
as
such
going
forward


work
with
regard
to
daily
routines
i
would
argue
that
many
industries
now
understand
that
working
out
of
an
office
is
not
necessary
for
many
jobs
and
thus
more
flexible
options
will
be
made
available


this
however
will
come
with
issues
1
under
privileged
people
will
still
be
not
part
of
these
possibilities


2
flexible
workplace/workhours
will
come
with
severe
mental
stress
that
will
have
to
be
dealt
with


3
this
might
have
an
impact
on
bolstering
rural
areas
where
people
will
now
be
able
to
work
without
having
to
commute


well
being
part
of
the
new
normal
will
be
dealing
with
the
ramifications
of
covid
19


this
is
in
part
about
health


we
still
do
not
know
about
the
mid
to
long
term
damages
covid
19
will
have
for
infected
people


it
is
likely
that
this
will
most
likely
affect
vulnerable
populations
and
that
this
divide
between
healthy
and
sick
will
also
be
detectable
by
race
and
class
so
similar
to
what
we
are
seeing
already
everywhere
in
the
world



how
each
country
decides
to
deal
with
this
societal
trauma
will
decide
each
societyâs
well
being


if
a
society
acknowledges
the
trauma
and
the
long
term
effects
it
will
have
to
offer
treatment
options
and
center
healthcare
around
people
not
money


if
society
and
political
leadership
is
willing
to
do
so
well
being
on
average
will
be
better


for
the
u

s


although
i
have
hope
i
am
skeptical
as
this
change
would
require
a
serious
shift
in
the
political
landscape
on
a
state
level


rather
i
will
say
that
the
well
being
similar
to
now
will
be
told
by
red/blue
state
and
wealth/race
parameters


and
indeed
i
believe
that
for
the
middle
and
upper
class
the
well
being
will
be
improved


they
will
profit
off
of
health
care
changes
in
employment
see
above
and
tax
breaks


for
vulnerable
populations
i
have
little
hope
that
well
being
will
improve


based
on
where
they
live
in
the
u

s


they
will
still
have
to
work
several
jobs
have
little
to
no
health
care
and
be
exposed
to
a
hyper
capitalist
logic
that
sees
them
as
replaceable
and
not
as
human
beings


privacy
this
will
get
worse
unfortunately


working
from
home
tele
visits
smartphones
smart
tvs
home
surveillance
data
brokers

will
all
contribute
to
a
loss
of
privacy


as
we
see
in

eu
the
gdpr
is
hardly
helping
in
protecting
citizenâs
privacy


in
the
u

s


there
are
few
attempts
to
even
do
so


rather
the
government
see
obama
before
has
shown
a
disdain
for
privacy


this
wonât
get
better


a
social
capital
system
like
in
china
is
not
too
impossible
for
the
u

s


i
believe
economic
security
will
be
on
the
axis
between
rich/poor

that

24/7

a

strategy
at

major

âwhat
i
would
like
to
be
true
is
that
everyone
develops
a
greater
sense
of
community
care
for
each
other


the
analogy
i
use
is
that
of
smoking


while
we
accept
that
smoking
is
a
personal
choice
we
have
come
a
long
way
in
realizing
that
one
personâs
personal
choice
directly
affects
others

a
result
many

in
the
use
of
common

accessible

has
developed
e

g


limited
indoor
smoking
and
controlled
outdoor
smoking


this
recent
pandemic
has
created
a
heightened
awareness
of
how
we
directly
affect
each
other


the
ânew
normalâ
has
to
incorporate
new
guidance
for
how
we
take
care
of
each
other


the
issue
of
âmasksâ
is
the
canonical
example
here
today


video
conferencing
is
becoming
normalized


this
is
good
and
bad


on
the
upside
it
is
great
to
have
a
more
efficient
method
of
working
together


weâre
learning
its
limitations


there
really
is
value
in
being
in
the
same
room
with
someone


but
weâre
leveraging
the
value
of
online
face
to
face


it
saves
time
and
requires
less
physical
travel
and
it
is
more
personal
than
a
simple
phone
call


however
the
seedy
underbelly
is
the
lack
of
security
and
privacy


âzoom
bombingâ
briefly
became
a
new
thing


culturally
do
we
really
have
that
much
disregard
for
each
other
that
we
have
to
do
such
things


from
a
technology
perspective
are
we
really
in
it
just
to
make
money
and
thus
security
is
a
second
priority


the
average
internet
user
will
always
expect
that
things
work
they
are
supposed
to
work


business
will
always
be
in
it
to
make
money


so
the
new
normal
will
be
a
greater
reliance
on
technology
even
to
the
point
of
tracking
people
and
even
less
security
and
privacy
because
average
people
wonât
even
know
it
matters
and
isnât
working

â
hopes
âtwo
things


first
our
digital
infrastructure
needs
help


the
requirement
here
is
that
if
weâre
going
to
rely
on
more
technology
then
we
need
to
be
able
to
support
it


at
the
most
basic
level
this
means
greater
bandwidth
to
everywhere


however
thatâs
simplistic
because
bandwidth
costs
money
and
distributing
that
cost
is
itself
problematic
for
a
variety
of
policy
reasons


so
thereâs
some
real
discussion
to
be
had
here


second
security
and
privacy
has
to
be
the
default
everywhere


this
is
not
trivial


in
the
u

s


in
particular
but
in
other
places
as
well
the
average
internet
user
doesnât
even
realize
how
insecure
and
public
everything
they
do
is


we
have
built
up
a
usage
of
âfreeâ
services
based
on
giving
up
security
and
privacy
and
we
have
not
made
this
clear
to
people


nor
has
business
bothered
to
be
open
about
it


there
is
movement
towards
greater
confidentiality
everywhere
i

e


the
use
of
encryption
but
without
a
baseline
requirement
the
rules
change
at
will
as
business
and
services
change
owners
for
features
and
usage


we
need
an
overarching
vision
and
a
commitment
to
its
success

lack

the

the
problem
with

what
happens
when

take

that


this

a

thatâs
what
scares
me

most
about

takes
problems
like
these

could
be
small
if
it
was
just
a
few
individuals

just

âany
conscious
government
by
now
should
have
been
able
to
come
to
the
realization
of
how
fragile
their
infrastructures
can
be
when
faced
with
such
a
global
pandemic


it
is
important
now
to
realize
how
international
relations
play
a
huge
role
in
determining
the
risk
faced
by
nations
in
such
times


there
has
been
a
way
to
curb
the
spread
by
the
application
of
certain
diplomatic
actions
and
measures
setup
in
some
nations
that
has
kept
the
impact
relatively
low
there


north
korea
for
example
by
virtue
of
its
relations
with
the
rest
of
the
world
proves
to
have
a
strategy
that
makes
it
less
vulnerable
in
times
like
this


considering
the
rest
of
the
world
i
have
observed
the
impact
of
cultural
inheritance
in
the
fight
against
the
pandemic
most
notably
from
some
scandinavian
countries
who
despite
the
steady
rise
of
infections
maintained
a
normal
flow
of
life
with
the
consciousness
that
they
were
dealing
with
an
existential
threat
while
the
rest
of
the
world
folded
into
lockdowns
at
different
levels
of
severity


it
has
not
been
uncommon
to
see
organisations
quickly
restructure
and
cause
a
steep
drop
in
economic
and
social
activity
throughout
an
entire
nation


many
who
did
not
set
up
plans
for
chaos
management
will
struggle
and
eventually
fade
out
into
oblivion
by
virtue
of
the
nature
of
the
business
models
they
operate
on


fast
forwarding
few
years
into
the
future
i
do
believe
that
the
importance
of
a
service
economy
will
become
more
apparent
even
to
nations
without
strong
participation


what
we
shall
see
is
a
rise
in
computing
service
demand
both
in
product
development
and
consumption


i
expect
internet
usage
to
more
than
triple
within
the
next
two
years
across
the
globe


the
demand
for
online
services
is
going
to
grow
at
a
geometric
rate
and
many
new
services
with
different
offerings
are
going
to
be
made
known
across
the
world


the
biggest
winners
are
those
who
engage
in
cloud
based
services
either
using
or
building
them


moving
operations
to
a
remote
mode
could
cut
down
production
costs
while
helping
companies
maintain
mostly
high
performance
staff
who
are
most
tech
savvy


those
who
are
fortunate
to
still
have
their
jobs
will
be
able
to
have
more
time
for
their
families
and
loved
ones
as
was
never
the
case
before


they
might
more
or
less
be
able
to
gain
more
fulfilment
in
their
job
if
they
maintain
the
same
levels
of
discipline


this
is
however
a
dangerous
and
tempting
event
that
could
also
cause
people
to
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
the
demand
has
increased
and
will
be
requiring
more
effort
to
monitor
and
drive
service
delivery


i
do
hold
the
view
that
we
are
going
to
be
more
and
more
sunk
into
our
electronic
gadgets
trying
to
keep
up
with
all
we
need
to
be
aware
of
about
our
environment
and
new
ways
of
connecting
and
staying
in
touch
are
going
to
be
developed


i
see
new
interfaces
for
communicating
at
a
more
profound
level
being
developed
and
quickly
gaining
widespread
adoption
even
in
very
low
or
third
world
economies


i
see
better
infrastructures
being
put
in
place
and
laws
around
handling
pandemics
designed
or
improved
for
future
response


thereâs
going
to
be
a
blueprint
for
how
different
nations
can
respond
to
such
events
without
creating
social
panic
while
ensuring
most
people
benefit
from
it
in
their
own
fair
share

â
hopes
âthe
technology
related
changes
that
i
would
hope
for
are
ones
that
change
the
interfaces
whether
physical
or
virtual
through
which
we
access
the
different
technologies
bringing
it
closer
to
a
more
profound
reality
such
that
one
gets
to
express
their
true
self
while
connecting
more
closely
to
their
surroundings


in
the
information
industry
this
could
involve
providing
individuals
with
a
direct
connection
to
the
source
of
truth
and
limiting
the
degree
to
which
third
parties
can
propagate
information


i
hope
for
smaller
gadgets
that
perform
at
scale
providing
small
services
that
are
efficient
and
greatly
increase
our
overall
productivity


then
i
also
imagine
an
industrial
design
that
gets
closer
to
how
nature
organises
itself
with
minimal
pollution
and
efficient
manufacturing


plants
for
example
shed
their
leaves
but
thereâs
not
necessarily
other
plants
to
sweep
them
away
but
they
are
in
turn
absorbed
by
the
soil
to
provide
nutrients


i
expect
technology
manufacturing
to
get
closer
to
such
manufacturing
designâ
worries
âtechnology
companies
especially
those
in
social

industry
benefit
from
the
audience
they
can
get
but
they
have
no
control
over
the
impact
of
the
information
shared
on

networks

the
sensitive
groups
out
there
no

hard
they
try

some
types
of

this
is
a
generally
known
âhard
problem
â
and
tech
alone
wonât
solve
it


what
we
need
is
to
take
a
step
back
to
consider
our
lives
without
some
form
of

and
slowly
begin
to
measure
how
much
of
an
impact
these
companies
have
on
our
lives
as
human
beings
and
how
necessary
they
are


tech
companies
often
set
out
to
remove
redundancies
that
exist
and
reduce
inefficiencies
that
may
exist
in
our
day
to
day
lives
and
that
doesnât
come
for
free


we
are
often
called
to
make
a
choice
of
being
exposed
and
managing
the
consequence
later
or
not
joining
the
bandwagon
in
the
first
place


some
software
and
machines
that
provide
a
value
of
some
kind
also
do
more
than
what
they
were
initially
designed
to
do
therefore
leaving
room
for
possibilities
that
may
expose
the
vulnerability
of
a
person
or
create
some
form
of
discomfort
even
when
the
value
provided
is
critical


in
certain
parts
of
the
world
thereâs
no
way
to
hold
the
companies
accountable
for
that
and
that
is
unfair


these
tech
companies
need
to
ensure
that
they
have
well
defined
and
respected
policies
wherever
their
products
can
be
distributed
and
used


if
i
buy
an
iphone
in
africa
usually
in
the
informal
market
thereâs
no
way
to
claim
damages
incurred
from
the
use
of
a
given
app
or
the
device
itself
from
apple
because
thereâs
no
specific
policy
for
africans
about
how
apple
products
are
expected
to
be
used
in
the
area
and
what
liabilities
they
are
responsible
for


companies
need
to
do
better
in
protecting
the
moral
integrity
and
safety
of
their
consumers
and
also
provide
clear
information
about
any
changes
they

a
new

anthropologist
said
âi
want
to
believe
that
life
will
be
better
for
most
people
in
2025


however
itâs
not
the
pandemic
that
will
determine
the
new
normal


itâs
the
2020
presidential
election


depending
on
who
wins
the
movements
set
in
motion
will
either
be
supported
and
pushed
further
or
there
will
be
government
and
societal
push
back
that
will
result
in
worse
conditions
for
everyone

â
a
participant
in
the
work
of
the
internet
engineering

said
âi
am
hopeful
that
the
u

will
fix
its
broken

system
now
that
it

rely
on
online

a

more


all
online

government

the
tradeoff
will
be
a
loss
of

the
head
of

at

âthere
will
be
reduced

â
the
following
predictions
are
from
respondents
who
said
most
peopleâs
lives
will
be
about
the
same
in
2025
as
they
were
prior
to
the
arrival
of
the
pandemic
a
longtime
well
known
technology
leader
said
âiâm
cautiously
optimistic


working
from
home
supported
by
communications
technology
could
create
more
employment
opportunities
across
a
wider
geographic
region
be
more
inclusive
and
encourage
diversity


while
cities
are
efficient
and
offer
advantages
to
residents
they
have
costs
although
they
do
seem
to
be
resilient
â
see
the
book
âscaleâ



we
could
reduce
transportation
congestion
pollution
energy
consumption
and
lower
the
cost
of
living
for
much
of
the
population
of
course
employers
will
align
pay
to
cost
of
living



the
current
crisis
has
exposed
our
fragile
supply
chains


their
brittle
structures
have
led
to
both
scarcity
and
waste
as
well
as
hardship
â
technology
could
help
reestablish
regional
production
and
distribution
and
supply
chain
agility
responding
to
black
swan
events
as
well
as
simple
shifts
in
consumer
demand
â
for
example
the
inability
of
food
supply
chains
to
move
from
restaurant
and
institutional
supply
to
consumer
supply
is
a
sad
state
of
affairs


telemedicine
implementation
might
finally
get
serious
in
order
to
provide
wider
access
to
health
care
at
lower
costs
to
more
of
the
population
â
a
lesson
that
should
be
learned
from
the
current
crisis
is
the
populationâs
health
and
welfare
is
everyoneâs
problem
if
not
attended
to


technology
can
increase
the
resiliency
of
individuals
as
well
as
firms
societies
geographic
regions
and
nations
â
we
might
find
a
better
balance
between
globalization
versus
populism


privacy
is
getting
a
bit
more
attention
and
i
applaud
appleâs
attempts
to
put
a
spotlight
on
this
on
behalf
of
their
users
â
we
will
see
how
this
unfolds

â
worries
âfacebook
is
amoral
irresponsible
and
evil
â
democracy
doesnât
stand
a
chance
against
facebook
and
how
it
can
be
used
to
undermine
community
and
escalate
division
at
scale
and
for
a
profit


itâs
hard
to
understand
how
facebookâs
executive
team
can
live
with
themselves


society
needs
clarity
either
a
firm
is
a
common
carrier
and
should
be
regulated
as
such
or
a
firm
must
take
responsibility
for
the
traffic
on
its
network


while
i
agree
that
amazonâs
human
resources
policies
need
a
lot
of
improvement
iâm
not
so
worried
about
amazon
microsoft
google
and
apple
â
there
is
plenty
of
competition


for
example
the
fuss
over
appleâs
app
store
policies
seems
rather
silly
â
it
is
their
platform
and
relative
to
installed
base
appleâs
market
share
is
small
and
faces
a
lot
of
competition


society
would
be
better
served
by
regulators
focusing
on
the
abuses
of
labor
unreasonable
productivity
measurement
systems
that
undermine
workersâ
health
and
safety
abuses
of
âcontractorâ
status
and
uses
of
loopholes
to
get
around
the
âcostsâ
of
responsibility


another
example
spotifyâs
claims
of
unfair
treatment
are
just
ludicrous
from
a
firm
that
has
practically
institutionalized
cheating
content
creators
â
how
do
we
solve
the
bigger
issue
of
a
lack
of
investment
in
detailed
accounting
systems
that
would
more
fairly
pay
content
creators


the
use
of
work
at
home
or
remote
work
technologies
to
unreasonably
track
and
monitor
employees
or
contractors
is
a
potential
risk


it
is
too
early
to
tell
where
this
will
lead
however
there
are
issues
that
might
not
be
in
the
best
interests
of
society


these
technologies
might
inadvertently
lead
to
discrimination
increasing
inequality
and
further
invasion
of
privacy
â
some
forms
of
regulation
or
standards
of
conduct
may
be
necessary

a
professor
of
computer
science
commented
âi
have
hope
for

enable

worries
âi

the
often

also
obvious

a
distinguished
professor
emeritus

engineering
wrote
âassuming
there
are
effective
vaccines
the
memory
of
covid
19
and
its
effects
will
fade
rapidly


as
evidence
i
would
cite
societyâs
response
to
the
1919
spanish
flu
epidemic


the
big
uncertainty
in
my
mind
is
the
extent
to
which
the

will
recover

2025


we
may
still
be
poorer
by
then
depending
in
large
part
on
government
policy

business
collapse
unemployment

so
forth


people
are
social

tribal
so
i
fully
expect
that
face

face
meetings
conferences

so
forth
will
resume
once
they

i
hope
there
will
be
innovations
in
telepresence

multi
party

that
make
face

meetings
less
important

iâm
skeptical


this
need
to
see
and
touch
each
other
is
deep
in
our
biology


work
from
home
will
gain
acceptance
but
regular
physical
presence
will
still
be
important


the
willingness
to
meet
in
person
will
continue
to
be
regarded
as
a
measure
of
interest/dedication/loyalty
so
signaling
it
will
continue
to
be
important


trends
toward
remote
interaction
such
as
telemedicine
and
virtual
walkthroughs
in
real
estate
will
continue
and
they
have
probably
been
given
a
boost
by
the
pandemic


academic
events
such
as
seminar
series
and
conferences
will
become
globally
available
via
recording
and
streaming


but
i
think
the
tribal
ritual
aspect
of
conferences
will
still
be
a
powerful
reason
for
people
to
be
physically
present
when
possible

hopes
âi
hope
that
the
legal

will
find

the
legal

slow

if

think
that

understand
the
systemic

is
a
knee
on

oh
i
forgot

iâm
male
so
of

i
did



between
#metoo

the
hatred
aimed
at
hillary
itâs
obvious
that
we
have
some
really
serious
misogyny
problems


making
*this*
society
more
fair
and
less
racist
is
a
marathon
and
not
a
five
year
sprint


of
course
global
warming
like
pandemics
is
part
of
this
dynamic
as
well


and
aside
from
early
mentions
by
democrats
like
jay

this
issue
has
been
driven
out
of
our
collective
consciousness
by
all
the
stupid
trump
stuff


really
trump
is
the
cautionary
tale


i
was
pretty
hopeful
when
obama
was
elected


i
was
quite
shocked
when
trump
beat
hillary


that
frankly
is
the
reason
why
i
canât
be
optimistic


that
close
to
half
the

were
willing
to
elect
a
person
who
is
racist
stupid
sociopathic

narcissistic
â
indeed
that
good
christians
could
vote
for
such
a
person
simply
because
they
wanted
pro
life
judges

means
that
a
very
large
portion
of
america
does
not
actually
understand
the
problems
facing
us


that
many
wealthy
people
support
trump
means
that
a
large
portion
of
u

s


capital/$$
does
not
care
about
the
problems

be

the
key
realities
of

the

my

for

off

of

for

at

whatâs
sad
is
that

any
of

at

to

perhaps
worst
that

a
professor
of
cognitive
science

âwe
canât
know
whether

weâre
at

turning
point


what
happens
in

next

have
a
big
influence

the
direction
the

takes

â
hopes
âmy
hope
is
that
we
make
many
changes


the
main
change
is
greater
governmental
and
societal
oversight
of
the
big
tech
companies


these
companies
are
hugely
influential
in
determining
how
information
flows
within
society
and
i
believe
many
of
the
trends
towards
authoritarianism
and
nationalism
that
we
see
in
world
politics
are
due
to
the
new
dynamics
of
information
in
society


these
flows
need
to
be
better
studied
and
understood
and
the
big
companies
are
not
good
at
participating
in
the
necessary
studies
they
have
a
conflict
of
interest


when
we
have
understood
better
how
information
flows
within
social
networks
and
other
internet
networks
the
big
companies
need
to
devote
more
resources
to
regulating
these
flows


they
are
already
imposing
censorship
through
recommender
engines
â
but
the
current
censorship
is
guided
mainly
by
profit
or
public
relations
motives
rather
than
the
social
good


democratic
governments
need
to
guide
the
way
censorship
happens
just
as
they
impose
broadcasting
standards
and
regulations


big
tech
companies
are
publishers
of
information
when
they
circulate
it
broadly


i
also
hope
for
a
reduction
in
the
global
inequality
that
has
been
exacerbated
by
the
big
tech
companies


on
the
ai
front

hope
the
countries
of
the
world
can
agree
on
a
ban
on

robots

worry
is
that
the
changes
i
hope
for
do
not
come
to
pass

a
consultant
expert
in
technical
regulatory
and
business
issues
said
âwhile
greater
use
of
telepresence
will
be
helpful
for
many
people
and
potentially
reduce
commuting
and
concomitant
road
traffic
it
may
also
lead
to
more
social
isolation
and
social
division


meeting
fewer
people
will
make
it
easier
to
exclude
âothers

hopes
âmy
hope
is
for
more
privacy
in
the
tech

â
it
is
now
dominated
by
surveillance
capitalism

worries
âmy
worry
is
a
near
future
with
even
more
surveillance
capitalism
with
sale
of
personal

becoming
intrusive
in
many
aspects
of
life

â
a
professor
of
international
affairs
and
economics
at
washington
dc
area
university
wrote
âobviously
there
are
two
scenarios


the
first
is
that
a
solution
to
the
covid
19
infection
crisis
will
be
implemented
and
life
will
return
more
or
less
to
what
it
once
was
â
minus
our
family
friends
and
acquaintances
who
have
died
from
the
disease


we
will
have
improved
our
facility
with
remote
technologies
and
this
in
turn
should
bring
down
our
need
to
travel
as
much
to
distant
venues
for
interacting
with
colleagues
around
the
world


it
might
even
alter
the
way
we
are
âat
work
â
allowing
remote
meetings
to
become
more
mainstream


this
would
mean
fewer
commutes
through
the
busy
washington
d

c


traffic


clearly
we
would
return
to
the
usual
way
of
delivering
classes
in
higher
education
but
with
a
greatly
enhanced
technological
toolkit
with
which
to
present
material
and
interact
with
students


the
second
scenario
would
be
one
in
which
covid
19
is
with
us
simmering
beneath
the
surface
for
years
to
come


clearly
we
will
discover
additional
coping
mechanisms
for
having
more
personal
interactions
while
staying
safe


however
itâs
clear
that
a
majority
of
interactions
would
have
to
remain
online
or
at
a
distance


i
am
presuming
that
in
this
case
new
technologies
will
arise
that
will
allow
clearer
communication
from
a
distance
and
under
a
mask


we
are
currently
using
our
telephones
for
this
as
relatives
quarantine
and
friends
gather
at
a
distance


there
will
be
many
more
events
outdoors
so
there
will
be
a
greater
need
for
public
space
and
less
need
for
traditional
indoor
gathering
places


employment
security
will
depend
on
the
ability
to
carry
on
providing
services
and
products
while
minimizing
risks


if
markets
worked
well
which
i
assume
they
will
not
the
wages
for
people
in
more
exposed
or
dangerous
jobs
would
rise


my
guess
is
that
in
this
environment
there
would
be
an
incentive
to
invest
in
all
sorts
of
protective
technologies


we
may
discover
that
some
workers
are
relatively
immune
to
the
virus
and
hence
be
more
willing
to
work
in
jobs
that
expose
them

â
hopes
âtechnology
can
close
gaps
between
people
in
ways
that
they
would
never
be
able
to
do
in
real
life
so
devoting
some
thought
to
how
technology
creates
community
might
yield
a
big
payoff


also
much
of
what
is
shared
online
and
is
held
up
as
ânewsâ
is
difficult
to
source


a
great
deal
of
effort
should
be
paid
to
technologies
that
allow
people
to
verify
who
is
responsible
for
a
given
story
or
where
a
particular
product
has
been
made

â
worries
âthe
internet
is
a
public
good
and
should
be
treated
as
such


many
have
made
billions
by
exploiting
this
public
good


itâs
time
for
governments
and
other
representatives
of
the
people
to
claim
back
our
rights


the
existing
model
by
which
companies
extract
information
from
individuals
and
sell
or
otherwise
monetize
that
information
has
shifted
power
from
the
individual
to
these
large
entities


given
how
new
technologies
have
been
created
and
then
regulated
in
the
past
it
strikes
me
that
itâs
time
for
countries
or
groups
of
countries
to
regulate
what
has
been
monopolized
due
to
the
obvious
economies
of
scale


an
unregulated
net
will
lead
to
a
greater
concentration
of
power

money

minimal


there
are
issues
with

i
do
like
some
of
the

experiments
with
the
use

am
most
worried

limited

the
executive

only
hope

political

i
believe
trump
will
be
defeated

the
powerful

i
also
hope
that

priority


we

the
people

âthe
only
thing
that

me
in
the

run
is
that
the

is
not
policed

regulated

regulation
has
to
be
part
of
the
next
new

there
is

donât
expect
the

having
worked
from

since
1994
i
donât
see
a
good
reason
that
more
people
canât
work
from
home
and
if
that
is
part
of
the
new
normal
to
my
mind
itâs
a
good
thing


many
jobs
canât
be
done
from

i
expect
they
will
continue
to
be
where
they
are

an
expert

said
âthere
will
definitely
be
parts
of
our

that
will
be
enhanced

not
enhanced
by
the
current
pandemic
but
on
balance
that
things
will
be
about
the
same


there
is
just
too
much
uncertainty
at
this
point

hopes
âi

for
more
data
privacy

user
control
over
how

is
being

worries
âi
am
concerned
over
the
further
commoditization

political
and
economic
gain

that
which
causes
the
further

health
and
creates
economic

âi
donât
think

care
about

base
this
on

are
very
dependent

a
longtime

responded
[this

first
two
of

worries
âtoo
much
delivery
of
misleading
and
biased
information
â
especially
from
hate
groups
racists
and
probably
foreign
funded
influencers


privacy

to
erode
in

a
very
tempting

in

potentially
big
impact

i
lump
facial

in
here
in
particular

â
an
anonymous
respondent
said
hopes
âthat
public
and
civic
technology
predominates
over
corporate
and
private
technology
and
the
neoliberal
ideology
is
expunged
from
the
internet

â
worries
âthat
public
and
civic
goals
will
not
be
put
first
and
current
trends
towards
greater
âsurveillance
capitalismâ
and
state
surveillance
will
continue

â
the
following
respondents
did
not
select
any
of
the
three
possible
choices
as
to
the
likely
future
of
digital
life
in
2025
in
the
wake
of
the
global
pandemic
the
director
of
a
group
exploring
the
future
of
lifelong
learning
commented
âi
suspect
that
online
education
particularly
for
higher
education
will
increase
with
some
potential
benefits
for
broadening
access


however
iâm
also
concerned
that
the
quality
of
remote
education
will
not
improve
substantially
or
produce
the
same
learning
outcomes
as
in
class
instruction


it
is
likely
that
many
companies
may
support
remote
work
as
some
tech
companies
are
already
starting
to
do
but
itâs
possible
this
will
lead
to
reduced
benefits
and
job
security
for
many
people
â
office
jobs
translated
into
remote
working
positions
may
be
treated
more
like
freelance
or
contracting
positions


existing
and
emerging
remote
collaboration
technologies
particularly
immersive
technologies
like
vr
and
ar
offer
some
opportunities
here
but
there
remain
substantial
technical
problems
to
be
solved
for
these
domains


while
itâs
likely
that
remote
learners
and
workers
will
rely
on
some
form
of
ar
in
the
future
many
fundamental
technical
challenges
will
still
exist
and
video
conferencing
will
likely
still
be
dominant


it
will
also
be
interesting
to
see
how
long
term
efforts
for
social
justice
and
equity
will
impact
the
development
and
use
of
contentious
technologies
like
facial
recognition
algorithmic
risk
assessment
and
audio
and
video
synthesis


while
there
will
be
short
term
pushback
on
some
of
these
technologies
iâm
pessimistic
about
the
likelihood
that
companies
and
academics
who
work
in
these
areas
will
reduce
efforts
in
these
areas
in
the
future


facial
recognition
and
other
data
driven
machine
learning
based
algorithms
for
categorizing
and
evaluating
people
will
unfortunately
be
a
large
part
of
our
society
in
the
future

â
a
longtime
leader
in
internet
engineering
said
âthings
are
going
to
be
different
from
how
they
are
now
but
will
they
be
better
or
worse


some
aspects
will
be
better


i
doubt
we
will
see
again
in
our
lifetimes
people
jumping
on
planes
for
professional
purposes
the
way
they
did
previously


thatâs
good
for
the
environment
and
for
families


it
may
also
have
other
benefits
in
terms
of
congested
regions
where
working
from
home
will
become
a
bit
more
of
the
norm
and
so
people
will
move
to
other
locales


on
the
other
hand
we
must
not
kid
ourselves


our
children
are
suffering
the
effects
of
this
pandemic
in
terms
of
having
to
âdistance
learn
â
which
is
not
natural
and
all
of
us
are
not
able
to
socialize
as
humans
are
meant
to
do


no
facetime
or
zoom
or
webex
can
substitute
for
a
hug

â
an
expert
in
political
science
observed
âsome
changes
will
be
good
for
some
but
not
good
for
others


there
is
class
race
and
gender
intersectionality
that
helps
us
understand
whose
life
might
be
improved
versus
those
whose
will
not


for
example
public
education
might
be
drastically
changed
and
those
changes
could
be
of
benefit
for
wealthier
and
white
families
but
detrimental
for
those
without
the
same
degree
of
wealth
or
access
to
education
choices
beyond
public
schools


same
with
caring
for
family
women
are
more
likely
to
bear
the
burden
of
childcare
and
domestic
responsibilities


age
will
also
make
a
difference
in
outcomes


economic
stability
employment
and
retirement
funds
will
be
harder
to
find
for
younger
generations
who
have
incurred
more
debt
and
less
economic
wealth
accumulation
than
older
generations


technology
will
be
much
more
a
part
of
our
life
than
it
is
already


during
the
past
five
months
or
so
people
across
the
spectrum
have
used
technology
in
ways
that
were
not
as
typical
pre
pandemic


in
particular
faculty/teachers
and
students
were
all
forced
online
and
this
might
dramatically
change
the
way
we
educate
and
the
reliance
on
technology
in
different
ways
for
teaching/learning

â
hopes
âmy
hope
is
that
access
to
technology
is
democratic
so
that
poorer
communities
or
individuals
have
access
to
common
technologies
so
that
they
are
not
left
out
and
behind

â
worries
âi
worry
over
the
collection
and
abuse
of
personal
data
and
privacy

â
the
head
of
a
major
pan
european
media
organization
commented
âuntil
the
end
of
the
20th
century
western
democracies
were
convinced
that
there
could
be
no
real
economic
development
without
democratic
regimes


the
collapse
of
communist
regimes
somewhat
provoked
by
the
arrival
of
networked
personal
computers
created
the
illusion
that
ideologies
were
dead
and
that
development
and
democracy
are
a
permanent
and
unavoidable
couple


then
the
economic
rise
of
china
came
to
prove
that
this
axiom
was
not
necessarily
true
it
proved
that
state
capitalism
can
prosper
without
democracy
provided
that
citizens
are
able
to
share
in
the
wealth
finding
consumer
goods
and
the
cultivation
of
well
being
to
be
more
accessible
to
all


the
internet
and
digitalization
could
provide
a
surrogate
for
democracy
while
at
the
same
time
allowing
undemocratic
states
to
exercise
mass
control
via
the
new
internet
tools


we
understand
that
amazon
or
alibaba
services
are
not
democratic
per
se
and
can
be
used
for
the
bad
or
for
the
good
depending
on
the
ethical
principles
on
which
they
are
built
and
depending
on
whether
democratic
control
if
any
is
exercised
on
them
or
not

â
the
co
director
of
a
center
for
the
study
of
war
and
peace
wrote
âi
disagree
with
any
effort
to
oversimplify
what
will
be
âgoodâ
or
âbetterâ
or
âbadâ
or
âworseâ
as
we
adjust
to
a
post
covid
19
world


i
am
fairly
certain
that
we
will
live
through
big
changes
but
these
will
likely
be
disruptions
some
major
and
some
minor


i
do
not
think
that
there
is
someone
who
can
be
reasonably
called
âthe
average
personâ
for
this
sort
of
analysis


rather
we
will
see
how
some
practices
â
such
as
perceptions
of
online
education
or
the
idea
that
work
requires
big
offices
â
will
change
radically
in
ways
that
are
both
âgoodâ
and
âbad
â
but
not
necessarily
leading
to
an
industry
collapse


on
the
other
hand
many
thousands
of
businesses
will
never
recover
restaurants
small
shops
etc


and
this
will
produce
massive
economic
dislocation
as
well
as
great
suffering
for
those
who
have
invested
so
much
of
their
lives
in
small
family
owned
enterprises


many
big
companies
will
survive
and
many
smaller
ones
will
fail


we
will
continue
to
witness
major
changes
in
all
of
the
areas
you
outline
in
the
question
security
privacy
employment
economic
security
etc

â
hopes
âtech
will
clearly
improve
all
sorts
of
information
sharing
even
as
it
will
continue
to
create
new
risks
and
shifting
understandings
of
what
life
is
all
about


many
aspects
of
online
servicing
increase
efficiency
and
access


i
run
an
online
masterâs
degree
program
and
we
can
teach
people
who
work
full
time
raise
families
and
live
anywhere
in
the
world


almost
none
of
these
students
could
set
aside
their
lives
move
to
arizona
and
study
full
time


in
medicine
we
will
see/are
seeing
some
similar
benefits


for
many
types
of
routine
care
taking
half
the
day
to
see
a
physician
or
nurse
provides
no
positive
benefits


and
in
far
deeper
ways
it
would
be
wonderful
if
this
crisis
would
yield
a
more
expansive
u

safety
net
greater
respect
and
protections
for
lower

workers
and
greater
trust
in
a
more
robust

effective

worries
âwe
need
a
new
language

new
rules/ideas

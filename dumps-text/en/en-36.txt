   All the later Covid lockdowns were "unnecessary", Dominic Cummings has
   claimed. During a podcast interview with the Spectator published this
   week, the former Number 10 chief adviser said it was "unarguable that
   there never needed to be any lockdown or anything approaching a
   lockdown in Quarter 3, Quarter 4 of 2020, or in 2021". Had the
   Government learnt more quickly from its early pandemic response, he
   suggested, "there would never have been any need for further lockdowns
   and all of the huge economic and other damage that they did."

   Cummings, who was working for then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson in
   Downing Street when Britain first entered a national lockdown in March
   2020, told the Spectator's Quite Right podcast that the initial
   measures were "very different" from those which followed. "The first
   [lockdown] was defensible in the sense of: there was no system, there
   was no testing, there was no nothing," he said. "All the officials who
   thought they had the world's best pandemic plan then suddenly admitted
   to us: `it's all bollocks and there is no plan. We don't know what
   we're going to do.'"

   According to the UK Covid Inquiry's second report, published in
   November, Cummings had warned Johnson in March 2020 that a lockdown was
   required in London to stop NHS services from "collapsing" within days.
   The political strategist reiterated this position during the Spectator
   interview, arguing that the NHS "was overwhelmed in places" and that
   "there's no hypothetical world in which" the then-PM would have gone
   against the policies of other European governments and refused to
   impose lockdown that spring. For Cummings, "some kind of short
   emergency measure was necessary in the circumstances."

   Britain's two main successes during the Covid era, in his view, "were
   doing vaccine research faster and doing rapid testing". If "the system
   had got its act together properly in summer 2020," Cummings told the
   podcast, "you'd have had a huge rapid-testing build-up" and "absolutely
   no need for lockdowns" later that year. While he stated that it was
   "very hard for me to see how the first one could have been avoided" in
   the context of the British Government's inadequate preparation,
   Cummings acknowledged that "there would definitely would have been no
   need for the first lockdown" had advisers and ministers engaged in
   "proper pandemic planning".

   During the new interview, Cummings also criticised the Covid Inquiry,
   which he accused of "completely botch[ing] its reporting over the whole
   thing". He added: "Either it's confused or it's lying -- who knows
   which, because it's so bad." The Inquiry reported last month that the
   adviser "poisoned the atmosphere" in 10 Downing Street during the
   response to Covid, insisting on making "key decisions [...] which were
   for the prime minister to make". Speaking to the Spectator, Cummings
   claimed that "all the later lockdowns were unnecessary and happened
   only because the pathological system itself just kept collapsing and
   couldn't find its way out of that."

   Young people have been among those most socially impacted by the
   COVID-19 pandemic, but also the most prepared to cope with the quick
   shift towards virtual environments that the pandemic triggered. For
   many young people in Europe and Central Asia, COVID-19 interrupted
   their schooling and left them jobless, and is still making it more
   difficult to integrate into the labour market. With school closures and
   uncertainty about their futures, many feel isolated, facing increased
   levels of stress, anxiety and depression.

   In the face of this situation, the United Nations Childrenâs Fund
   (UNICEF) and the European Training Foundation (ETF) joined forces to
   look at the challenges, opportunities and, most importantly, the views,
   sentiments and opinions of young people concerning their current and
   future prospects in the era of COVID-19. This regional report builds on
   wide consultations with more than 15,000 adolescents and young people
   from Europe and Central Asia covering, among others, their feelings
   about lockdown restrictions, access and participation in education,
   learning outcomes and the quality of teaching, as well as their views
   on mobility, entrepreneurship and participation. When it comes to the
   future, the report captures young peopleâs hopes and fears about deep
   changing societies and economies, as well their recommendations for a
   more inclusive, equitable, peaceful, sustainable and prosperous future
   in Europe and Central Asia.

   On April 8, 2020, the Chinese government lifted its lockdown of Wuhan.
   It had lasted 76 days -- two and a half months during which no one was
   allowed to leave this industrial city of 11 million people, or even
   leave their homes. Until the Chinese government deployed this tactic, a
   strict batten-down-the-hatches approach had never been used before to
   combat a pandemic. Yes, for centuries infected people had been
   quarantined in their homes, where they would either recover or die. But
   that was very different from locking down an entire city; the World
   Health Organization called it "unprecedented in public health history."

   The word the citizens of Wuhan used to describe their situation was
   fengcheng -- "sealed city." But the English-language media was soon
   using the word lockdown instead -- and reacting with horror. "That the
   Chinese government can lock millions of people into cities with almost
   no advance notice should not be considered anything other than
   terrifying," a China human rights expert told The Guardian. Lawrence O.
   Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University, told
   the Washington Post that "these kinds of lockdowns are very rare and
   never effective."

   The Chinese government, however, was committed to this "zero-COVID"
   strategy, as it was called. In mid-March 2020, by which time some 50
   million people had been forced into lockdowns, China recorded its first
   day since January with no domestic transmissions -- which it offered as
   proof that its approach was working.  For their part, Chinese citizens
   viewed being confined to their homes as their patriotic duty.

   For the next two years, harsh lockdowns remained China's default
   response whenever there was an outbreak anywhere in the country. But by
   March 2022, when the government decided to lock down much of Shanghai
   after a rise in cases in that city, there was no more talk of
   patriotism. People reacted with fury, screaming from their balconies,
   writing bitter denunciations on social media, and, in some cases,
   committing suicide. When a fire broke out in an apartment building,
   residents died because the police had locked their doors from the
   outside. And when the Chinese government finally abandoned lockdowns --
   an implicit admission that they had not been successful in eliminating
   the pandemic -- there was a wave of COVID-19 cases as bad as anywhere
   in the world. (To be fair, this was partly because China did such a
   poor job of vaccinating its citizens.)

   One of the great mysteries of the pandemic is why so many countries
   followed China's example. In the U.S. and the U.K. especially,
   lockdowns went from being regarded as something that only an
   authoritarian government would attempt to an example of "following the
   science." But there was never any science behind lockdowns -- not a
   single study had ever been undertaken to measure their efficacy in
   stopping a pandemic. When you got right down to it, lockdowns were
   little more than a giant experiment.

   Despite the lack of scientific evidence, lockdowns didn't come out of
   nowhere, at least not in the U.S. They had been discussed -- and argued
   over -- by scientists since 2005, when (as the story goes) President
   George W. Bush read John M. Barry's book The Great Influenza, about the
   1918 pandemic. "This happens every hundred years," Bush is supposed to
   have said after finishing the book. "We need a national strategy."

   In fact, there were people thinking about pandemic mitigation long
   before Bush read Barry's book. The leader of this ad hoc group was D.A.
   Henderson, perhaps the most renowned epidemiologist of the 20th century
   -- the man who, decades earlier, had led the team that eradicated
   smallpox. Richard Preston, the author of The Hot Zone, would later
   describe this feat as "arguably the greatest life-saving achievement in
   the history of medicine."

   By the time Bush began pushing his administration to come up with a
   pandemic plan, Henderson was 78 years old. Ten years earlier, he had
   sat in on a series of top-secret briefings where he listened to a
   Russian defector describe how he had led a team that was trying to
   adapt the smallpox virus for bioweapons. Henderson became so concerned
   that he started a small center focused on biodefense -- which meant, in
   effect, defending against a pandemic. He and his colleagues at the
   center had spent years trying to persuade government officials to take
   pandemics seriously -- without much success. When the Bush
   administration began debating what its pandemic strategy should
   include, it was only natural that Henderson be involved.

   The men Bush chose to lead the effort believed that lockdowns could be
   an important component of a mitigation plan. They were heavily
   influenced by a model developed by Laura Glass, a 14-year-old
   high-school student from Albuquerque (aided by her scientist father),
   that purported to show that keeping people away from one another was as
   effective as a vaccine. (This story is told, overexcitedly, in Michael
   Lewis's book The Premonition.)

   Henderson vehemently disagreed. For one thing, he didn't trust computer
   models, which churned out estimates based on hypotheticals. Just as
   important, they couldn't possibly anticipate the complexity of human
   behavior. "There is simply too little experience to predict how a
   21st-century population would respond, for example, to the closure of
   all schools for periods of many weeks to months, or the cancellation of
   all gatherings of more than 1,000 people," he said.

   In addition, he felt that the worst thing officials could do was
   overreact, which could create a panic. In 2006, as the debate inside
   the Bush administration was nearing its conclusion, he co-authored a
   paper in a final effort to change the minds of those devising the
   strategy. The paper concluded: "Experience has shown that communities
   faced with epidemics or other adverse events respond best and with the
   least anxiety when the normal social functioning of the community is
   least disrupted. Strong political and public health leadership to
   provide reassurance and to ensure that needed medical care services are
   provided are critical elements. If either is seen as less than optimal,
   a manageable epidemic could move towards catastrophe."

   The Bush team's final document, published by the CDC in February 2007,
   stopped short of mandating lockdowns but came as close as its authors
   dared, calling for the use of "social distancing measures to reduce
   contact between adults in the community and workplace." One of the
   leaders of the effort, a government scientist named Richard Hatchett,
   would later tell Lewis what he really believed: "One thing that's
   inarguably true is that if you got everyone and locked each of them in
   their own room and didn't let them talk to anyone, you would not have
   any disease."

   Which is true as far as it goes. There were other questions, though,
   that were at least as relevant. Could the kinds of lockdowns that are
   achievable in the real world, where hundreds of millions of people
   can't live in isolation chambers, be an effective tool against a
   pandemic? Did the virus truly go away during a lockdown or simply hide,
   waiting to reemerge when it ended? And finally, did the many social,
   economic, and medical downsides make them, in the aggregate, not worth
   whatever short-term benefits they might yield?

   Henderson, who died in 2016, never stopped making the latter case.
   "D.A. kept saying, `Look, you have to be practical about this,'" says
   his former deputy, Tara O'Toole. "`And you have to be humble about what
   public health can actually do, especially over sustained periods.
   Society is complicated, and you don't get to control it.'"

   As the United States gains more and more distance from the COVID
   pandemic, the perspective on what worked, and what did not, becomes not
   only more clear, but more stark. Operation Warp Speed stands out as a
   remarkable policy success. And once the vaccines became available, most
   states did a good job of quickly getting them to the most vulnerable,
   especially elderly nursing-home residents.

   Unfortunately, there is no shortage of policy failures of which to take
   stock. We do an accounting of many of them in our new book, The Big
   Fail. But one that looms as large as any, and remains in need of a full
   reckoning in the public conversation, is the decision to embrace
   lockdowns. While it is reasonable to think of that policy (in all its
   many forms, across different sectors of society and the 50 states) as
   an on-the-fly experiment, doing so demands that we come to a conclusion
   about the results. For all kinds of reasons, including the country's
   deep political divisions, the complexity of the problem, and COVID's
   dire human toll, that has been slow to happen. But it's time to be
   clear about the fact that lockdowns for any purpose other than keeping
   hospitals from being overrun in the short-term were a mistake that
   should not be repeated. While this is not a definitive accounting of
   how the damage from lockdowns outweighed the benefits, it is at least
   an attempt to nudge that conversation forward as the U.S. hopefully
   begins to recenter public-health best practices on something closer to
   the vision put forward by Henderson.

   After China came Italy, the second country to be hit hard by the
   coronavirus. The Italian government responded with a lockdown almost as
   tough as China's. By the time it was lifted, in early June, 34,000
   Italians had died of COVID-19, up from 630 when the lockdown was first
   imposed.

   Those were frightening numbers. But when Neil Ferguson saw what had
   transpired in Italy, he saw an opportunity. For Ferguson, the head of
   the infectious disease department at Imperial College London, the
   Italian government's decision to follow China's example meant that
   lockdowns were suddenly a real-world policy option in Western
   democratic societies, not just in an authoritarian country like China.
   As a disease modeler, he believed the same thing Richard Hatchett
   believed: that if he could lock everyone in a room, the virus would go
   away. But he had long assumed attempting to do so was politically
   impossible.

   Ferguson is an important epidemiologist, renowned for his estimates,
   derived from computer models, of possible deaths from a newly emerged
   virus. As soon as he learned of the outbreak in Wuhan, he and several
   colleagues began modeling the coronavirus. On March 17, Ferguson laid
   out the team's findings at a press conference. Their model predicted
   that, without serious countermeasures, a staggering 81 percent of the
   population in the U.S. and Britain would become infected, and that
   510,000 people in Britain and 2.2 million Americans would die of COVID
   by late 2020. In addition, the authors wrote, "We predict critical care
   bed capacity would be exceeded as early as the second week in April,
   with an eventual peak in ICU or critical bed care demand that is over
   30 times greater than the maximum supply in both countries."

   For Ferguson, the purpose of the report wasn't just to release their
   shocking estimates; it was also to push the American and British
   governments to commit to lockdowns for the long haul. "[T]his type of
   intensive intervention package," the authors wrote, "will need to be
   maintained until a vaccine becomes available (potentially 18 months or
   more) -- given that we predict that transmission will quickly rebound
   if interventions are relaxed."
   It worked. In the U.K., Prime Minister Boris Johnson had initially
   planned to keep the country open. Instead, he ordered a lockdown within
   a week of Ferguson's press conference. (Shortly after Johnson imposed
   the lockdown, Ferguson was visited twice by his mistress. For obvious
   reasons, this caused a furor when it was discovered. Ferguson was the
   first, though hardly the last, Establishment bigwig to ignore the
   COVID-19 rules they demanded of everyone else.)

   As for President Donald Trump, he never used the word lockdown, but he
   was worried enough to  call for the country to adopt social distancing
   as a mitigation strategy. Schools, restaurants, businesses -- they all
   closed. White-collar employees who were able to work from home did so.
   More than once, Trump mentioned that 2.2 million lives were at stake,
   referring to Ferguson's estimate. Trump's order wound up lasting six
   weeks.

   Most governors issued their own "stay-at-home" orders, usually stricter
   than Trump's. Even Governor Ron DeSantis in Florida -- who would soon
   become an outspoken opponent of mainstream mitigation measures --
   reluctantly went along for a brief period. But there were important
   questions that no one advocating for lockdowns addressed, maybe because
   in the urgency of the moment the questions didn't occur to them. How
   long would they last? And even if lockdowns did slow the virus's
   progression, what would happen when they were lifted?

   Regardless, in the space of two months, lockdowns had gone from being
   unthinkable to being an unquestioned tool in the pandemic toolkit.

   When state public health officials explained to the country's governors
   why lockdowns were necessary, they talked primarily about "bending" or
   "flattening the curve." And when governors then explained the strategy
   to their constituents, they used the same rationale. "If we change our
   behaviors," said California governor Gavin Newsom in announcing his
   state's lockdown on March 19, "we can truly bend the curve to reduce
   the need to surge." The day after Newsom, then-Governor Andrew Cuomo
   announced a lockdown plan for New York. He called it his PAUSE program
   -- Policies Assure Uniform Safety for Everyone -- but really, it was
   the same thing.

   What did flattening the curve mean? Here's what it didn't mean: It did
   not mean that if people stayed in their homes, COVID-19 would fade away
   (even if that idea was often suggested in non-expert contexts). Rather,
   flattening the curve meant delaying the virus spread to prevent
   hospitals from becoming overwhelmed with COVID patients. During their
   early press conferences, many governors would display a chart showing a
   sharp increase in the estimated rate of COVID-19 infections. That's
   what would happen without lockdowns, they explained. Then they would
   display a second chart showing a more gradual upturn once lockdowns and
   other mitigation measures took effect. Simply put, flattening the curve
   was about helping hospitals manage the crisis rather than ending the
   crisis. Even those who later criticized lockdowns largely agreed on
   this point. As David Nabarro, the World Health Organization's COVID-19
   envoy (and an eventual lockdown critic), put it, "The only time we
   believe a lockdown is justified is to buy you time to reorganize,
   regroup, rebalance your resources, protect your health workers who are
   exhausted, but by and large we'd rather not do it."

   In many blue states, however, that rationale was forgotten over time,
   and many people remained confined to their homes or apartments not just
   for a few weeks but for a year or more -- even after the vaccine became
   available. And many of the country's biggest cities continually
   reimposed lockdowns whenever there was an uptick in COVID cases -- not
   just telling people to shelter in place, but also closing small
   businesses and restaurants, outlawing sports events and social
   gatherings, and shutting down in-school learning.

   Which naturally leads to the obvious question: Did lockdowns help keep
   Americans alive? Studies were mixed -- in their findings, their
   methodology, even their definition of lockdown. For instance, in August
   2020, eClinicalMedicine, an offshoot of the prestigious British medical
   journal The Lancet, printed a study that concluded that "full lockdowns
   and wide-spread COVID-19 testing were not associated with reductions in
   the number of critical cases or overall mortality." In March 2021,
   Christian Bjørnskov, an economist at Aarhus University in Denmark,
   compared weekly mortality rates in 24 European countries that used
   mitigation measures with varying degrees of severity. "[T]he findings
   in this paper suggest that more severe lockdown policies have not been
   associated with lower mortality," the economist wrote. "In other
   words," he added, "the lockdowns have not worked as intended."

   Michael Osterholm, the prominent epidemiologist at the University of
   Minnesota, also doesn't think lockdowns did any good. "There is
   actually no role for lockdowns," he says. "Look at what happened in
   China. They locked down for years, and when they finally relaxed that
   effort, they had a million deaths in two weeks." As for flattening the
   curve, "that's not a real lockdown," Osterholm says. "You're just
   reducing contact for a few weeks to help the hospitals."

   Dr. Anthony Fauci was probably the best-known defender of lockdowns as
   a life-saving measure. But the policy continues to have many defenders
   within the public health establishment. Howard Markel, a doctor and
   medical historian at the University of Michigan, believes they
   succeeded. "The amount of lives saved was just incredible," he says.
   Markel pointed to an August 2023 study by the Royal Society of London
   that concluded that "stay-at-home orders, physical distancing, and
   restrictions on gathering size were repeatedly found to be associated
   with significant reduction in SARS-CoV-2 transmission, with more
   stringent measures having greater effects."

   Still, the weight of the evidence seems to be with those who say that
   lockdowns did not save many lives. By our count, there are at least 50
   studies that come to the same conclusion. After The Big Fail went to
   press, The Lancet published a study comparing the COVID infection rate
   and death rate in the 50 states. It concluded that "SARS-CoV-2
   infections and COVID-19 deaths disproportionately clustered in U.S.
   states with lower mean years of education, higher poverty rates,
   limited access to quality health care, and less interpersonal trust --
   the trust that people report having in one another." These sociological
   factors appear to have made a bigger difference than lockdowns (which
   were "associated with a statistically significant and meaningfully
   large reduction in the cumulative infection rate, but not the
   cumulative death rate").

   In all of this discussion, however, there is a crucial fact that tends
   to be forgotten: COVID wasn't the only thing people died from in 2020
   and 2021. Cancer victims went undiagnosed because doctors were spending
   all their time on COVID patients. Critical surgeries were put on hold.
   There was a dramatic rise in deaths due to alcohol and drug abuse.
   According to the CDC, one in five high-school students had suicidal
   thoughts during the pandemic. Domestic violence rose. One New York
   emergency-room doctor recalls that after the steady stream of COVID
   patients during March and April of 2020, "our ER was basically empty."
   He added, "Nobody was coming in because they were afraid of getting
   COVID -- or they believed we were only handling COVID patients."

   So in attempting to gauge the value of lockdowns, the most appropriate
   way is to look not just at COVID deaths but at all deaths during the
   pandemic years. That's known as the "excess deaths" -- a measure of how
   many more people died than in a normal year. One authoritative
   accounting was compiled by The Spectator using data gathered by the
   OECD. It showed that during the first two years of the pandemic -- 2020
   and 2021 -- the U.S. had 19 percent more deaths than it normally saw in
   two years' time. For the U.K., there was a 10 percent rise. And for
   Sweden -- one of the few countries that had refused to lock down its
   society -- it was just 4 percent. An analysis by Bloomberg found
   broadly similar results. In other words, for all the criticism Sweden
   shouldered from the world's public health officials for refusing to
   institute lockdowns, it wound up seeing a lower overall death rate
   during the pandemic than most peer nations that shut down schools and
   public gatherings. It is not unreasonable to conclude from the
   available data that the lockdowns led to more overall deaths in the
   U.S. than a policy that resembled Sweden's would have.

   There were other negative consequences too. In the U.S., lockdowns
   forced hundreds of thousands of small business closures. They
   exacerbated inequality, as Amazon warehouse workers and meatpackers
   showed up to crowded workplaces while the "Zoom class" locked down at
   home. Worst of all, though, it had a devastating effect on children
   whose schools were closed as part of a lockdown. During the first weeks
   of the pandemic it probably made sense to close schools given how
   little was known about the coronavirus. Better safe than sorry. But by
   the time school started up again in the fall of 2020, two things were
   clear. The first was that remote learning was a disaster. The second
   was that there was surprisingly little transmission among kids in
   school. Well-to-do parents moved their children to private schools,
   many of which reopened their classrooms. But most big-city
   public-school systems continued to rely on remote learning well into
   the 2020-2021 school year. It was a tragic policy choice.

   In ProPublica and The New Yorker, the journalist Alec MacGillis vividly
   described the consequences in Baltimore. With no classrooms to go to,
   thousands of students abandoned school. The school system made free
   laptops available, but few students took the trouble to get one.
   Teachers gave up trying to prod those who didn't log onto their remote
   classes. Plus, teachers had kids of their own to take care of, which
   made it difficult to teach.

   The anti-lockdown scientist Jay Bhattacharya of Stanford University
   recalls a photograph in the San Jose Mercury News during the early
   months of the pandemic. It showed two children, 7 or 8 years old,
   sitting with Google Chromebooks outside a Taco Bell. "They were on the
   sidewalk doing schoolwork because that was the only place they could
   get free Wi-Fi," Bhattacharya said. "Their parents weren't there
   because they had to go to work. I mean, that should have ended the
   lockdown right then and there. It should have at least ended school
   closures."

   Public schools have an importance that goes beyond education. It's
   where many of the rituals of childhood and young adulthood take place.
   For children who live in unstable homes, school offers some stability.
   Public schools serve free breakfast and lunch to disadvantaged kids.
   And they're a place where parents know their children are safe when
   they're at work. One consequence of lockdowns was that millions of
   children had to fend for themselves because their parents couldn't
   afford to quit their jobs to take care of them.

   One child psychiatrist, who works with underprivileged autistic kids,
   began the pandemic believing in the importance of lockdowns and other
   mitigation measures. But over time, she changed her mind.

   "What really drove me was my clinical experience," she said. "What
   happens to a child when every single support is removed from them?
   What's the impact on the family and the siblings? What I was seeing was
   complete regression. It was devastating, and the downsides of lockdowns
   and school closings were not being openly discussed in the mainstream
   media. I was horrified. Why aren't we talking about this?" She
   described the situation she saw as 2022 wore on as a "sickening
   mental-health crisis."

   The science also weighed heavily in favor of opening schools. By
   mid-summer 2020, when cities were trying to decide whether to reopen
   schools in September, 146,000 Americans had died of COVID-19. Fewer
   than 20 were children between the ages of 5 and 14. More schoolchildren
   died from mass shootings in a typical year. Emily Oster, a Brown
   University economist, conducted a survey of about 200,000 children who
   were back in classrooms. The infection rate, she discovered, was 0.13
   percent among students and 0.24 percent among teachers -- an
   astonishing low number. Oster then set up what she called the National
   COVID-19 School Response Dashboard, which eventually tracked 12 million
   kids in both public and private schools and continued to collect
   infection-rate data over the next nine months. Not once did the student
   rate hit one percent during any two-week span.

   "We do not want to be cavalier or put people at risk," Oster wrote in
   The Atlantic. "But by not opening, we are putting people at risk, too."

   Over the entirety of the pandemic, the essential facts about schools
   never changed. The infection rate for teachers in Sweden, where most
   schools stayed open, was no higher than the infection rate for teachers
   in Finland, which had closed its schools. In early 2021, three CDC
   scientists acknowledged in the Journal of the American Medical
   Association: "As many schools have reopened for in-person instruction
   in some parts of the U.S. ... there has been little evidence that
   schools have contributed meaningfully to increased community
   transmission."

   So why did so many big-city schools stay closed long after the evidence
   was clear? There were three reasons. The first, and most
   understandable, was fear. No matter how small the chance, no parent
   wanted his or her child to die from COVID-19. And no teacher wanted to
   become infected while in school and bring COVID-19 home. Because kids
   often brought colds and flus to school -- which then spread to others
   -- both parents and teachers had a hard time accepting that that was
   not how the virus spread. Here, for instance, was a typical comment
   from a teacher in Westchester, reacting to a series of New York Times'
   articles about reopening schools:

     Tell me how to get a 6-year-old to not sneeze on his friends let
     alone play and work from a distance (mucus, saliva, pee, poop, this
     is all part of our day at the lower levels of education). Tell me
     how each child is going to have her own supplies for the day as
     shared supplies are no longer an option. No more Legos, no more
     books. Tell me how to comfort a hysterical child from a distance of
     six feet.

   That it was well established that the coronavirus was not spread
   through saliva or pee or by sharing books didn't matter. Too many
   people were simply unable to judge risk rationally -- a problem due in
   part to unwillingness of government officials to talk honestly about
   COVID-19. In 2020, for instance, COVID-19 ranked below suicide, cancer,
   accidents, homicide, and even heart disease as a cause of death for
   children under the age of 15, according to CDC data. Yet public-health
   experts did not stress any of this -- on the contrary, many of them
   emphasized instead that children could get COVID-19 without explaining
   how small the risk was. Is it any wonder, then, that COVID-19 seemed to
   be the only thing parents and teachers focused on?

   The second factor was Trump. On July 6, he tweeted, "SCHOOLS MUST
   REOPEN IN THE FALL!!" The next day, at a White House event, the
   president said, "We're very much going to put pressure on governors and
   everybody else to open the schools. It's very important for our
   country. It's very important for the well-being of the student and the
   parents."

   In this case, Trump happened to be right; it was important. But by this
   late stage in his presidency, most Democrats assumed that anything he
   said was a lie. If Trump said schools should reopen, that was reason
   enough for them to assume they should stay closed. The sense that
   opening up was a Trump-endorsed policy seems to have energized
   opposition to it in blue America -- even as data accumulated that the
   harm being done to the country's children outweighed any potential
   benefit.

   The third reason was the teachers' unions. Public-school teachers were
   unionized, and their unions -- American Federation of Teachers (AFT)
   and the National Education Association (NEA) -- were allies of, and
   contributors to, the Democratic Party, which dominated most major urban
   areas. They held enormous sway over big-city school systems.

   No one can doubt that teachers were afraid of dying of COVID-19. They
   truly believed they were putting themselves in harm's way if they went
   back into a classroom full of children. But instead of helping their
   members see how small the risk truly was, the teachers' unions embraced
   the fight to keep teachers away from the classroom.

   By the time September 2020 rolled around, at least a dozen of America's
   biggest cities started the school year remotely. They included Los
   Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Chicago, and Houston -- all cities
   with the kind of large, disadvantaged communities that would suffer the
   most if schools were closed. In most cases, city officials said they
   were trying to move from remote learning to at least a hybrid model, in
   which students would spend several days a week in classrooms and the
   rest of the week online.

   In school districts that did open their schools that fall, the results
   were remarkably aligned with Emily Oster's data. In New York, Mayor
   Bill de Blasio was finally able to get the schools open in late
   September; between Thanksgiving and the end of the year, the city's
   positivity rate rose from 3 percent to 6 percent. The positivity rate
   in the public schools also rose -- from 0.28 percent to 0.67 percent.
   "The safest place in New York City is, of course, our public schools,"
   said de Blasio. To the holdout unions, those numbers didn't matter.
   Ultimately, only 15 percent of school districts offered full-time
   classroom instruction during the fall 2020 semester.

   By 2022, journalists, academics, and even some public-health officials
   were finally coming to grips with the enormous damage done to children
   -- especially disadvantaged children -- because of remote learning. A
   lengthy analysis by two professors in The Atlantic toted up some of the
   issues. First, millions of kids simply gave up on learning. In New
   York, even after schools had reopened, the chronic absentee rate was 40
   percent -- up from 26 percent before the pandemic. Studies showed that
   public-school children got less exercise (no recess) and ate more junk
   food (no free hot meals) during the pandemic. According to a CDC
   survey, during the first six months of 2021, nearly half the
   high-school students surveyed "felt persistently sad or helpless."
   Parental emotional abuse was four times higher than in 2013, and
   parental physical abuse nearly doubled, The Atlantic reported.

   A study by three major research institutions, including Harvard's
   Center for Education Policy Research, showed that the longer a school
   relied on remote learning, the further behind their students were. "In
   high-poverty schools that were remote for more than half of 2021, the
   loss was about half of a school year's worth of typical achievement
   growth," said Thomas Kane, the director of the Harvard center.

   Although test scores in 2023 would suggest that students were slowly
   catching up, those scores didn't take into account the kids who had
   dropped out entirely. One analysis found an estimated 230,000 students
   in 21 states whose absences could not be accounted for. They had simply
   gone missing.
   "The pandemic has amounted to a comprehensive assault on the American
   public school," concluded the authors of The Atlantic article. Yet as
   late as the fall of 2022, there were still those who refused to
   acknowledge the damage done by lengthy school closings.

   One such person was Anthony Fauci. In August 2022, Fauci announced that
   he planned to retire at the end of the year. Over the next few months,
   he made the rounds to discuss how the country had fared during the
   pandemic. Invariably, he was asked whether he regretted his forceful
   advocacy of lockdowns, especially given its effect on children. At one
   forum, he said, "Sometimes when you do draconian things, it has
   collateral negative consequences ... on the economy, on the
   schoolchildren." But, he added, "The only way to stop something cold in
   its tracks is to try and shut things down."

   What he could never acknowledge was that "shutting things down" didn't
   stop the virus, and that keeping schools closed didn't save kids'
   lives. Then again, to understand that, you had to be willing to follow
   the science.

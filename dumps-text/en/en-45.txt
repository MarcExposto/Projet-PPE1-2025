ABSTRACT
     __________________________________________________________________

   South Asia is a hotspot of air pollution with limited resilience and
   hence, understanding the mitigation potential of different sources is
   critically important. In this context the country lockdown initiated to
   combat the COVID-19 pandemic (during March and April 2020 that is the
   pre-monsoon season) provides an unique opportunity for studying the
   relative impacts of different emission sources in the region. Here, we
   analyze changes in levels of air quality species across the region
   during selected lockdown periods using satellite and in-situ datasets.
   This analysis compares air quality levels during the lockdown against
   pre-lockdown conditions as well as against regional long-term mean.
   Satellite derived AOD, NO[2], and CO data indicates an increase of
   9.5%, 2%, and 2.6%, respectively, during the 2020 lockdown period
   compared to pre-lockdown over the South Asia domain. However,
   individual country statistics, urban site data, and industrial grid
   analysis within the region indicate a more varied picture. Cities with
   high traffic loads reported a reduction of 12-39% in columnar NO[2]
   during lockdown, in-situ PM[2.5] measurements indicate a 23-56% percent
   reduction over the country capitals and columnar SO[2] has an
   approximate reduction of 50% over industrial areas. In contrast,
   pollutant emissions from natural sources e.g., from biomass burning
   were observed to be adversely affecting the air quality in this period
   potentially masking expected lockdown related air quality improvements.
   This study demonstrates the need for a more nuanced and situation
   specific understanding of sources of air pollutants (anthropogenic and
   natural) and for these sources to be better understood from the local
   to the regional scale. Without this deeper understanding, mitigation
   strategies cannot be effectively targeted, wasting limited resources as
   well as risking unintended consequences both for the atmosphere and how
   mitigation action is perceived by the wider public.

1 INTRODUCTION
     __________________________________________________________________

   The effects of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) global pandemic are
   wide ranging and of high impact. According to the World Health
   Organization (WHO), the first reported case was in December 2019 in the
   Wuhan district, Hubei Province, China (Li et al., 2020; WHO Newsroom,
   2020). The rapidity of its transmission globally and severity of its
   impacts lead to a global public health emergency (Lai et al., 2020;
   Phua et al., 2020). Mortality and morbidity rates rapidly rose and
   public health concerns lead to the conditions of "lockdowns" where
   movement of people and economic activity was highly restricted to
   reduce the spread of the disease. Lockdown related restrictions on
   industry and transport affected global and regional economies (ICIMOD,
   2020; World Bank, 2020). Another result of these lockdowns were reports
   of reductions in air, water, and noise pollution levels, reduced waste
   generation and increased atmospheric visibility (McNeill, 2020;
   Zambrano-Monserrate et al., 2020).

   Air pollution or air quality (AQ) is a pressing environmental issue
   with 91% of world population living with air pollution levels above WHO
   air quality guideline thresholds (WHO, 2022). AQ received increased
   public attention during the pandemic times in many parts of the world
   due to media reporting of anecdotal evidence suggesting a general
   improvement in highly polluted regions. A number of studies have indeed
   reported decrease in primary pollutants (PM[2.5], CO, NO[x]) at a
   number of locations as well as in some cases increases in secondary
   pollutants such as ozone (O[3]). Rates and levels of decrease have been
   shown to be variable globally depending on species and location
   (Fattorini and Regoli, 2020; Sharma et al., 2020b; Venter et al.,
   2020). These reported changes were shown to be negligible or did not
   follow a fixed trend on regional scales (Kanniah et al., 2020; Menut et
   al., 2020). This is taken to indicate that regional-scale studies were
   needed to better understand the impacts on AQ of COVID-19 restrictions
   and changes. South Asia (SA) is a global air pollution hotspot, that
   contains approximately 25% of the global population (United Nations,
   2019) and a wide range of areas with sensitive biodiversity and fragile
   ecosystem (Wester et al., 2019). Regional lockdowns and restrictions
   have provided an unprecedented opportunity to study AQ due to the
   enforced reduction in human movement and industrial activity in the SA
   region. This is particularly important in SA as the region is impacted
   by a wide variety of emission sources both anthropogenic and natural.
   Anthropogenic sources include crop residue burning, household cooking
   and heating, waste burning, emission from transportation, industrial
   activity and coal-based power generation, etc. (e.g., Jayarathne et
   al., 2017; Saikawa et al., 2019). Regional natural sources of emissions
   include forest fires, recirculation of mineral dust, seas salts and
   natural emissions (Jena et al., 2015; Vadrevu et al., 2019). This
   non-homogeneous restriction on air polluting sectors presents an
   opportunity to understand sector-specific contribution of different
   emission sources to AQ in the region at a range of scales from region
   to country to city. The economic impact of restricted activity did not
   affect all sectors equally with intensive sectors such as transport
   being affected more than residential sector. The lockdown resulted in a
   reduction of 10-31% in GDP, the equivalent of approximately 307-921
   billion dollars (Kanitkar, 2020) primarily associated with restrictions
   on the transport, industry, and power sectors. Thus, providing an
   opportunity to understand the potential of implementing mitigation
   measures in these sectors and its associated costs. In this manuscript,
   we examine the heterogeneous impacts of lockdown on AQ drivers over SA
   using satellite and in-situ datasets to better understand future
   scenarios for mitigation of poor AQ. This study also highlights the
   need for a sector and or activity based understanding of AQ to enable
   effective and efficient implementation of mitigation strategies,
   especially in regions with potentially limited infrastructure and
   resource.


2 MATERIALS AND METHOD
     __________________________________________________________________

   In this study, we quantify the impact of COVID-19 and associated
   restriction on levels of aerosol and gaseous pollutants over the
   selected SA domain using satellite and in-situ data. The focus
   countries were Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal
   and Pakistan with a deeper analysis of Nepal as an example of changes
   observed in mountainous regions of SA. Country scale AQ analysis was
   based on megacity and city scale data as well as selected areas of
   major industrial activity. The analysis period was
   01^st March-30^th April 2020, which includes approximately 3 weeks of
   data prior to the implementation of COVID-19 restrictions and 5 weeks
   of continuous data under more complete national lockdowns. Exact dates
   for lockdown implementation varied from country to country (see Table
   1) with most SA countries having implemented restrictions approximately
   from the third week of March.

   Table 1. List of lockdown implementation timeline in different
   countries.

   To maintain consistency the period 1^st-20^th March was selected as the
   pre-lockdown period, with the 25^th March to 30^th April period was
   designated as the lockdown period. Selected satellite data for 2020 in
   general and the study period in particular were compared with available
   data from 2000-2019. To reduce the influence of missing values in daily
   satellite measurements (e.g., as a result of cloud cover, data quality
   thresholds and limitations in swath areas) available data was converted
   to a 5 days rolling mean for use in this study (e.g., Bechle et al.,
   2013; Engel-Cox et al., 2004).


2.1 Observation from Space

   Most SA countries have limited ground-based observations of air
   pollutants (Martin et al., 2019; Saikawa et al., 2019) and any
   available in-situ observations are not representative for the entire
   region. To overcome this, multiple satellite based remote sensing
   products were used (Martin, 2008) along with available in-situ data.


2.1.1 Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)

   The Terra and Aqua Satellite platforms were launched in 1999 and 2002
   respectively in solar-synchronous polar orbits. They are equipped with
   MODIS multispectral instruments providing continuous measurements of
   aerosols/clouds. In this study Level 2 (MOD04_L2) and Level 3
   (MOD08D3), collection 6.1 aerosol products at 0.55 µm were used
   (1^st March to 30^th April for 2000 to 2020). The spatial resolution of
   L2 and L3 products is 10 km (at nadir) and 1° × 1°, respectively. The
   accuracy of MODIS AOD products over land is estimated to be within 0.05
   ± 0.2 AOD (Kaufman et al., 1997). Validation analysis of collection 6.1
   products over the SA and Indian regions also showed a good agreement
   with AERONET observations (Bhattarai et al., 2019; Mangla et al., 2020;
   Wei et al., 2019a, b). MODIS active fire products were also used to
   provide the timing and spatial distribution of large scale fires in the
   region (Giglio et al., 2003; Justice et al., 2002).


2.1.2 Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI)

   The OMI system aboard NASA's Aura spacecraft was placed in a
   sun-synchronous polar orbit in 2004. It is a nadir-viewing instrument
   and measures backscattered solar radiation in the 0.27-0.5 µm
   wavelength range with a spectral resolution of 0.42-0.63 nm. This
   backscatter is used to derive column densities of different criteria
   pollutants including NO[2] and SO[2] at a resolution of 13 km × 24 km
   at nadir (Levelt et al., 2006). The instrument has a 2600 km wide swath
   at the earth's surface and a local afternoon equator crossing time of
   13:45. In this study Level-3 daily gridded NO[2] product (OMNO2d)
   binned and averaged into 0.25 × 0.25 degree global grids was used (see
   Haq et al., 2015). Only total column NO[2] with a cloud fraction less
   than 30% was used (for a detailed analysis of the version-3 OMI
   NO[2] product see Krotkov et al., 2017). For SO[2] the Level-3 daily
   global SO[2] data product (OMSO2e), based on the Band Residual
   Difference (BRD) algorithm was used (see Krotkov et al., 2006). Each
   grid point contained one observation of SO[2] total column density for
   the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL). This data point was selected from
   all good Level-2 pixels that overlap the study grid, excluding
   observations affected by row anomalies according to the method
   described in Jabeen et al. (2019) and Mallick et al. (2019).


2.1.3 TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI)

   TROPOMI is a spectrometer launched on the Sentinel-5 Precursor (S-5 P)
   mission as a single-payload satellite in a sun-synchronous orbit by the
   European Space Agency. TROPOMI covers the ultraviolet (UV), visible
   (VIS), near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) ranges
   (Veefkind et al., 2012). with a daily global coverage at a spatial
   resolution of 7 × 7 km^2 with a swath of 2600 km. Total column density
   of CO is derived from the measurement of Earth's radiance spectra in
   the 2.3 µm spectral range of the shortwave infrared (SWIR) region
   (Fu et al., 2016; Landgraf et al., 2016). This study used the Level 3,
   Offline (OFFL) CO dataset for 2019 and 2020 (limited due to age of
   satellite) from the Google Earth Engine platform data catalog
   (Gorelick et al., 2017). Initial validation of TROPOMI CO data was
   shown to have a good agreement with the Copernicus Atmosphere
   Monitoring Service (CAMS) dataset over the Asian region (Borsdorff et
   al., 2018).


2.2 Ground-Based Observations

2.2.1 US embassy surface air quality observations

   The United State (US) Department of State (DOS) and the United State
   Environmental protection agency (U.S. EPA) collectively monitor AQ from
   U.S. embassies and consulates globally. Measurements follow federal
   reference or equivalent monitoring methods approved by the U.S. EPA.
   Data from these monitoring stations is made accessible via the DOS
   AirNow platform. Embassy hourly PM[2.5] data for 9 cities (Kabul,
   Islamabad, Lahore, New Delhi, Kathmandu, Kolkata, Dhaka, and Yangon)
   for the 1^st March to 30^th April period were used in this study (Fig.
   S1).


2.2.2 Nepal AQ data

   Particulate matter (PM) measurements over Nepal (see 3.5) from an urban
   site in the Kathmandu city centre (Ratnapark established in 2016) and a
   semi-urban site in Kavre (Dhulikhel, established in 2017; also
   background site for Kathmandu) were used for this study. Both sites
   were established by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain
   Development (ICIMOD) in collaboration with the Government of Nepal's
   Department of Environment (DoEnv) (see Mahapatra et al., 2018). Date
   used was real-time PM[10], PM[2.5], PM[1] at 60 Hz from a laser
   scattering instrument (Environmental Dust Monitor-180, Grimm Aerosol
   Technik GmbH, Germany) and meteorological parameters (WS700-UMB smart
   weather sensor, Lufft, Germany).


2.2.3 AErosol RObotic NETwork dataset (AERONET)

   AERONET , Version 3 Level 1.5 AOD data at 500 nm was used from sites at
   Bidur, Pokhara, and Kyanging Gompa to understand the aerosol variation
   in high altitude regions of Nepal (Holben et al., 1998). These sites
   were strategically chosen to study the transport of pollutants from low
   lying plains into high mountains areas through valleys. Here, Bidur and
   Pokhara represent two valley sites and Kyanging Gompa represents a high
   mountain site just below the Yala glacier in Nepal. Details of
   measurements carried out by the group at Yala glacier can be seen in
   Gul et al. (2021) and Rai et al. (2019).


3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
     __________________________________________________________________


3.1 Sources of Pollution in South Asia

   Air pollution across the SA region can be attributed to a wide range of
   natural and anthropogenic emission sources which show significant
   variations at a range of temporal scales. The impact of COVID-19 driven
   restrictions on AQ requires the understanding of existing emission
   scenarios over the study domain. For this, anthropogenic and open
   burning emission from the Regional Emission inventory in Asia (REAS3.1)
   and Global fire emission database (GFED) were analysed over the study
   domain to estimate the share of various emission sources typical for
   the months of March and April period (Kurokawa and Ohara, 2019; van der
   Werf et al., 2017). National and regional scale emission inventories
   are limited for Asian countries as no country except Japan is legally
   required to submit annual national emission inventories under the
   UNFCCC or similar conventions (Janssens-Maenhout et al., 2015; Kurokawa
   and Ohara, 2019). As a result of which emission estimates from SA are
   primarily based on individual project-based emission inventories. These
   individual project-based emission inventories are spatially and
   temporally discontinuous and as a result are a known source of
   uncertainty in regional emission inventories. Table 2 shows the
   relative share of major emission sectors for three major pollutants
   (PM[2.5], NO[x], and CO) over SA for March and April (emission data for
   year 2015 is used for this analysis). Open fires and the residential
   sector were major contributors to PM[2.5] and CO emissions for these
   months. The residential sector contributed 29% to PM[2.5] emission and
   35% to CO emission. Over the domain 43% of PM[2.5] emissions and 32% of
   CO were attributed to open fire burning, the majority of which is
   forest fire though there is a significant contribution from
   agricultural waste burning. Studies have identified the residential
   sector as the largest regional source of primary aerosol as an annual
   average (Lelieveld et al., 2015) but for the pre-monsoon season, the
   relative share of emissions from forest fires and open biomass burning
   dominates other sources (Jena et al., 2015). As Myanmar experiences
   widespread forest fires during the pre-monsoon season this is expected
   to play an important role in affecting the regional pollutant levels
   during the lockdown period. A study in the pre-monsoon season
   (undertaken between 18^th March 2006 to 11^th May 2006) reported that
   BC emission from biomass burning in SA were higher than those from
   anthropogenic sources (327 Gg and 203 Gg respectively). For this period
   Myanmar accounted for ~80% of all fire activity (Kumar et al., 2015).
   For Nepal open burning is reported as the biggest source annually (>
   50%) and the residential sector the second biggest source of
   PM[2.5] and CO (Shrestha, 2018). The transport and energy sectors are a
   small proportion of PM[2.5] and CO emissions (combined 12% and 10%
   respectively, Table 2). It is important to note here that residential
   emissions, a major source of PM[2.5] and CO, were not restricted
   through lockdown guidelines so is not expected to change significantly.
   The effects of pre lockdown migration or people movement associated
   with COVID-19 was not considered in detail in this study.

   Table 2. Percentage contribution of major emission source sector over
   the south Asia domain during March and April months. It is estimated
   with REAS3.1 anthropogenic emission inventory and GFED fire database
   for the year 2015.

   The transport sector, industrial emission, and the energy sector are
   major sources for NO[x] emission over SA with 35%, 31%, and 15% share
   of total emissions respectively in March and April, compared with 44%
   and 52% for Europe and USA and 29% (Crippa et al., 2018). Lockdown
   enforced restrictions included industrial and transport activities,
   however, relaxation of regulation was also provided for the supply and
   production of essential and emergency services, so emissions from this
   sector are also not expected to be zero. This large-scale decrease in
   economic activity also resulted in a reduction in power demand with
   approximately 12.0%, 28.6%, 18.3%, and 26.1% reduction (peak power
   demands) reported in Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, and India, respectively
   (Agrawa et al., 2020). In response to the reduction in power demand,
   renewable energy was given priority over coal-based power plants in
   part due to their marginal cost of production (statement by, Tim
   Buckley, IEEFA's Energy Finance studies) which is expected to reduce
   emissions from the energy sector during the lockdown. A significant
   reduction in re-suspended dust and construction dust was also expected
   due to restrictions on vehicular traffic and construction activities.
   However, on-road re-suspended dust, construction dust, and industrial
   dust are major contributors in cities and industrial zones and are not
   included in the emission inventories (Guttikunda et al., 2019;
   Philip et al., 2017). From the emission data it could be broadly
   expected that a strict lockdown would bring substantial reductions in
   NO[x] levels whereas mitigation of the residential sector and control
   of forest fires would be required for a significant reduction in
   PM[2.5 ]and CO levels.


3.2 Impact of Lockdown on the Air Quality of South Asia

   From the existing literature it can be seen that across SA, pollutant
   levels tend to be higher in April compared to March. Therefore, this
   study analyses the change in AQ due to lockdown in three ways (a)
   comparison of AQ during lockdown with long-term datasets, (b)
   comparison of AQ during lockdown with the AQ in the pre-lockdown period
   in 2020, (c) The impact of lockdown on annual intraseasonal trends in
   AQ for the entire study period. Long-term data sets used in the
   analysis includes the available data sets for the previous years for
   each pollutant.


3.2.1. Comparison of lockdown period (2020) mean with historical long-term
mean

   Fig. 1 (left panel) shows the long-term mean (years preceding 2019)
   satellite-derived columnar AOD, NO[2], SO[2], and CO over SA for the
   lockdown period (25 March-30 April). An understanding of the spatial
   distribution of the pollutants across SA during this period in previous
   years was deemed necessary to examine the impact of lockdown imposed in
   2020. The mean for the year 2020 (Fig. 1, middle panel) represents the
   mean during the COVID-19 forced lockdown period, and the difference
   between long-term mean and 2020 means displays the changes due to
   lockdown (Fig. 1, right panel).

   Fig. 1. (Left) Long-term mean of AOD (2000-2019), NO2 (2005-2019), SO2
   (2005-2019) and CO (2019) during the 25th March-30th April lockdown
   period over south Asia. (Middle) AOD, NO2, SO2, and CO for 2020 over
   south Asia during the 25th March-30th April lockdown period. (Right)
   Difference between 2020 AOD, NO2, SO2 and CO compared to their
   long-term mean. Fig. 1. (Left) Long-term mean of AOD (2000-2019),
   NO[2] (2005-2019), SO[2] (2005-2019) and CO (2019) during the
   25^th March-30^th April lockdown period over south Asia. (Middle) AOD,
   NO[2], SO[2,] and CO for 2020 over south Asia during the
   25^th March-30^th April lockdown period. (Right) Difference between
   2020 AOD, NO[2], SO[2] and CO compared to their long-term mean.

   Long-term data shows that AOD was usually high over the IGP and eastern
   part of the SA domain due to its high population density, residential
   and industrial emissions and forest fires (Fig. 1). In general, the AOD
   over IGP also remains high throughout the year and exhibits a west to
   east transition depending on the seasons (Dey and Di Girolamo, 2011).
   High aerosol loads often penetrate the surrounding Himalayan foothills
   and high mountain regions lying North of the IGP, which has also been
   observed in earlier studies (Rupakheti et al., 2017). These mountainous
   regions in the North are also influenced by emissions of seasonal
   forest fires (Mehra et al., 2019). AOD gradually decreases while moving
   towards the South of the IGP with few patches of high loading in the
   central and eastern regions of India. In contrast to widely distributed
   AOD over SA, NO[2] and SO[2] are localized to distinct hotspots. High
   NO[2] levels are found over cities primarily owing to vehicular
   emissions, whereas high SO[2] levels are observed over industrial zones
   and power plant locations. Open burning also contributes to 11% of
   total NO[2] emission over SA hence NO[2] hotspots are also observed in
   the forest fire dominated eastern part of the SA domain. High CO levels
   are seen in the eastern side of the SA domain including Myanmar,
   Bangladesh and the Eastern states of India (Fig. 1). Such high CO
   levels in these regions are attributed to the frequent forest fire
   activity during the pre-monsoon season (Girach and Nair, 2014). Over
   SA, the long-term mean of columnar AOD, NO[2], and CO during the
   lockdown period was 0.41 (0.40-0.42, 95% CI), 3.35 × 10^15 (3.33 ×
   10^15-3.37 × 10^15, 95% CI) molecules cm^-^2, and 0.033 (0.32-0.33, 95%
   CI) mole m^-^2 respectively. While that for the year 2020 was 0.42
   (0.40-0.44, 95% CI), 3.77 × 10^15 (3.69 × 10^15-3.84 × 10^15, 95% CI)
   molecules cm^-^2 and 0.0346 (0.343-0.349, 95% CI) mole
   m^-^2 respectively. However, SO[2] means for this large domain from OMI
   are near zero (Krotkov et al., 2016).

   The spatial mean of AOD, NO[2], and CO over SA during the lockdown
   period show an increase of 2.6%, 12.6%, and 5% respectively in 2020
   compared to the long-term means. Fig. 1 shows marked heterogeneity
   (Table 3, Fig. 1). The decrease in AOD is higher over the IGP, ranging
   from approximately 0.1 to 0.4; this accounts for a 20 to 80% decrease
   in AOD. However, in the same period, an increase of AOD from 0.2 to 0.4
   was observed in the eastern part of the domain; this is approximately a
   20-60% increase over the long-term mean of this period. Similar to our
   findings, a decrease of 46% in AOD over North India and 42% in the
   Eastern IGP during the lockdown period compared to the 3 year mean
   using satellite data sets was reported by Kant et al. (2020). Reduction
   in anthropogenic emissions due to restricted activities is main reason
   for decrease in AOD over IGP, whereas forest fires is responsible for
   increase in AOD over eastern part of the domain. CO levels in the year
   2020 indicate an increase in most of the region, whereas some decrease
   was observed over the IGP. NO[2] was shown to have decreased by ~20%
   over the majority of the region, while in the Eastern part an increase
   of ~20-40% was observed.

   Table 3. Percentage change in AOD, NO2, and CO level over the south
   Asia domain and major countries during the 2020 lockdown period
   compared to their long-term means. The 95% confidence interval for the
   percentage change is given in parenthesis.

   The spatial heterogeneity in patterns of decrease or increase of
   pollutants compared to their long-term mean over the region and at
   country-level were also studied. Changes in AOD, NO[x], and CO during
   the lockdown period compared to their long-term mean over individual SA
   countries was shown to have significant variation (Table 3) with 8%,
   15%, and 24% decreases in AOD over India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan and
   an increase of 15% in Myanmar. An increase in mean AOD over India from
   0.35 to 0.39 was reported for the year 2020 compared to the year 2019
   (Pathakoti et al., 2020). This can be attributed to interannual
   variability so a comparison with long-term mean is expected to provide
   a more robust tool in the analysis of effect of lockdown on AQ. A
   significant reduction in AOD with respect to its long-term mean was
   reported over India (Ranjan et al., 2020) which was similar to our
   finding for India. Similarly, a 4-10% decrease in NO[2] level was
   observed for India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan whereas a slight increase
   of 2% was observed over Myanmar. A 17% reduction in NO[2] over India
   for March 2020 compared to the 10-year mean was reported and attributed
   to COVID-19 driven lockdowns (Metya et al., 2020).


3.2.2 Comparison of pre and during lockdown period in 2020

   Satellite-derived data for AOD, NO[2], SO[2], and CO during lockdown
   was compared with that of the pre-lockdown period (Figs. 2 and 3). On
   the regional scale (over SA) AOD, NO[2], and CO indicate an increase of
   9.5%, 2%, and 2.6%, respectively, during the lockdown period compared
   to the pre-lockdown in 2020 (Table 4). During the lockdown period, the
   AOD level over the IGP region decreased (relative to pre lockdown
   values) while an increase was observed in the Eastern part of the
   domain and Northern mountain regions. A decrease in AOD for IGP,
   north-west and east India, and increase over central India during the
   lockdown period was also observed in another study that used both MODIS
   terra and MODIS aqua data (Pandey and Vinoj, 2021). A reduction in
   NO[2] levels was observed over the majority of the SA region but a
   substantial increase was observed in the Eastern area. An increase in
   NO[2] was also observed in the mountainous region along the Northern
   side of the IGP, with patches of high NO[2] also observed in central
   India; an area of significant industrial activity, with a number of
   power generation plants, and significant mining activity. The CO
   spatial distribution shows an increase over the majority of the region
   with a higher increase in the eastern part. More CO was seen in the
   forest fire-dominated regions in the Eastern part of the domain which
   was seen to spread to the majority of the region due to the rapid
   mixing and transport of CO coupled with its atmospheric lifetime. For
   SO[2 ]a decrease was reported only over the industrial gridded areas,
   while other regions did not show any clear evidence of change.

   period compared to the pre-lockdown period for the south Asia domain

   The 95% confidence interval is given in parenthesis.

   Country-specific line plots from running averages of pollutants from
   satellite data are shown in Fig. 3. These clearly show the variation
   reported for the pre and post lockdown phase compared to SA. For
   Myanmar, the AOD and CO data showed sustained growth in levels during
   the lockdown phase that can be attributed to forest fires over this
   region (Fig. 4). A decline in NO[2] levels during lockdown was observed
   to be consistent in majority of the countries attributing to lower
   vehicular emissions. An increase in levels of CO was observed in all
   countries except Pakistan linked to increased forest fire and biomass
   burning activity. It indicates the possible influence of change in
   meteorological parameters (like relative humidity, temperature, and
   solar insolation) and variations in forest fire emission from March to
   April. These changes again indicated that with prohibitions on
   vehicular activity and industrial operations, the level of pollutant
   reduction at a regional scale is not even close to 50%, indicating the
   presence of other important emission sectors (e.g., residential or open
   burning sources). From this analysis it is clear that a focus on
   mitigation has to be concentrated on the dominant and cost-effective
   sectors, at least in this season.

   and Myanmar with India and Myanmar on the right Y-axis, and Bangladesh
   and Pakistan on the left Y-axis.


3.2.3. Comparison of the pre and during lockdown trends for 2020 and selected
long-term dataset

   Daily mean of AOD, NO[2] and CO obtained with historical long-term
   datasets over SA shows an increasing trend during the study period
   (01^st March-30^th April); similarly, individual countries also
   indicate an increasing trend. Such a variation might be attributed to
   the increase in forest fire, agricultural waste burning of rabi crop,
   and frequent dust episodes prevalent during the dry season
   (Sadavarte et al., 2016; Yadav et al., 2017). The dry season
   (pre-monsoon) also experiences high winds that favors the transport of
   dust which contributes to the entire AOD column (Madineni et al.,
   2021). The influence of relative humidity and favorable meteorological
   conditions might also be probable causes of AOD enhancement reported
   over central India (Pandey and Vinoj, 2021). The long-term data in this
   study suggests an increase of 12.5%, 4.9%, and 3.6% in AOD, NO[2], and
   CO, respectively during the lockdown time compared to the pre-lockdown
   time over SA (Table 5). However, in the year 2020, the percentage
   increase in AOD, NO[2], and CO over SA is restricted to 9.5%, 2.0%, and
   2.6% respectively during the lockdown in comparison to the pre-lockdown
   period (Table 4). The lower percent increase of AOD, NO[2], and CO
   during 2020 compared with the long-term data could be attributed to the
   effect of lockdown implemented over the region. In a similar analysis
   for individual countries, Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh AOD values
   declined by 15.6%, 18.3%, and 14.4% respectively during the lockdown
   period in comparison to the pre-lockdown period (Table 4). But the same
   in long-term data increased by 13.6%, 8.2%, and 14.4% for Pakistan,
   India, and Bangladesh respectively (Table 5). On the contrary, AOD
   values for Myanmar indicated an increase of 39.8% during the lockdown
   period in comparison to the pre-lockdown phase, and a 24.3% increase
   was seen with long-term datasets. This can be interpreted as the net
   decrease of 26-30% over India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, 15.4% increase
   over Myanmar, and the net decrease over SA domain by 3%. The decline in
   the NO[2] trend is also observed for SA as well as for Pakistan, India,
   Bangladesh, and Myanmar (Tables 4 and 5). Over SA, mean CO showed an
   increase of 2.5% while that for India and Bangladesh increased by 2%
   and 1% respectively. Whereas for Myanmar it increased by 5% and in
   Pakistan, it remained almost unchanged with a slight decrease of 0.5%.

   Table 5. Percentage change in AOD, NO2, and CO level during previous
   years lockdown period (25th March-30th April) compared to the previous
   years pre-lockdown period (1st March-20th March) with their long-term
   dataset (2000 to 2019 for AOD, 2005 to 2019 for NO2 and 2019 for CO)
   for south Asia and major countries. The 95% confidence interval for the
   percentage change is given in parenthesis.

   The share of different emission sources varies among the individual
   countries, which is one of the major factors in determining the impact
   of lockdown on the AQ (Venter et al., 2020). Cities of China and the
   USA have shown variations in the impact of lockdown and similarly, the
   variation is also reported in China and India (Metya et al., 2020;
   Shakoor et al., 2020). Such variability can be attributed to variation
   in emission share from different sectors of China and the USA and also
   the extent of lockdown. The share of residential emission is large, and
   it is widely distributed over the SA region. Hence, complete mitigation
   of the residential sector emission in South Asian countries can achieve
   considerable improvement in AQ regionally (Lelieveld et al., 2019;
   Upadhyay et al., 2018). Simulations with zero-out emission sectors for
   the globe predicted that removing transport sector emission will reduce
   PM[2.5] concentration by 6-7% in India, East Asia, and Southeast Asia
   whereas it reduces 27-28% PM[2.5] in North America and Europe (Silva et
   al., 2016). Whereas phasing out residential and commercial sector
   emission will reduce 42% of PM[2.5] in India and 10% and 20%
   PM[2.5] reduction in North America and Europe (Silva et al., 2016).
   However, we don't expect any considerable change in residential sector
   emission and hence significant reduction at the regional scale is not
   observed in the SA region. In general, India has spent approximately $
   13.7 billion year^-^1 on emission control of which 80% was spent on the
   transportation sector whereas the cost of LPG and similar subsidy
   activities is $ 6 billion per year (Cameron et al., 2016; Purohit et
   al., 2019). A recent study estimated that the reductions in household
   emission would allow the achievement of national ambient AQ standards
   for PM[2.5] (Chowdhury et al., 2019). These studies performed over
   India indicate that the expenses for mitigation measures in transport,
   industrial sectors are higher than the residential sector, but the
   potential of air pollution reduction is higher in residential sector
   than the others. Hence, mitigation in residential sector emission is
   comparatively cost effective as well as efficient than mitigation
   measures for transport and industrial sector. It indicates that
   prioritizing emission control for particular sources can expedite the
   air pollution mitigation process.

   A decline in pollutants level for Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh
   depicts the influence of lockdown-driven reduction in anthropogenic
   emission whereas the rise in Myanmar is reflecting the increase in
   forest fire emission during this period. Total fire count over South
   Asia increased from 2150 counts day^-^1 in the pre-lockdown period to
   2359 counts day^-^1 during lockdown with a large-scale forest fire
   event were observed during 25^th March to 06^th April (Fig. 4).
   Residential sector emissions as a major contributor to CO remains
   almost unchanged during this period. So, forest fires as the other
   biggest contributor to CO levels was the most probable reason for such
   an increase.


3.4 Local-Scale Air Quality Analysis

   From the above analysis, it was concluded that on a regional basis
   lockdown measures did not bring in a significant improvement in AQ. An
   analysis of various satellite and in-situ PM[2.5] data obtained from
   the US embassy at a city-scale over individual country capitals (Kabul,
   Islamabad, Delhi, Yangon, Thimphu, Kathmandu, and Dhaka) and major
   industrial grid in the SA region was undertaken. The industrial grid
   was chosen within India between 20.5-22.5 N and 81.5-85.5 E. This grid
   includes a number of coal (e.g., southeastern coal field limited, HIL
   coal mines, Hindalco coal mines), and other mines (like zink mines,
   stone mine, cement mines, metal mines), along with thermal power
   stations (Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee thermal power station, Atal
   Bihari Vajpayee thermal power station, Jindal thermal power limited,
   Hasdeo thermal power station, Acbil thermal power plant, Hydel power
   plant). AQ for other industrial cities like Karachi in Pakistan,
   Singrauli and Jamshedpur in India, Hetauda in Nepal, and Chattogram in
   Bangladesh were also analyzed (Table 6). Mean AOD for the lockdown
   period was reduced by approximately 20% over Islamabad and New Delhi
   whereas a 15-20% reduction was seen in the selected industrial grid and
   Yangon. An approximate 10% decrease was observed over Dhaka. Cities
   with heavy vehicular loads like Dhaka and New Delhi showed substantial
   percentage reductions of approximately 39% and 21% in NO[2 ]burden.
   Compared to the 5-year mean of NO[2 ]over New Delhi a 54% reduction was
   observed in OMI NO[2] data (Pathakoti et al., 2020) which were similar
   to those observed in the present study. Similar decline in
   NO[2 ]concentration during the lockdown period was shown for many
   cities across the world through satellite and ground-based observation
   (Sharma et al., 2020b; Venter et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). A small
   percentage decrease (ranging between 0.5 to 3%) in CO levels was
   observed over Lahore, Islamabad, New Delhi, and Dhaka during the
   lockdown period compared to the pre-lockdown period. Kathmandu and
   Thimphu showed an increase in mean AOD, NO[2], and CO levels during the
   lockdown period compared to pre-lockdown. An increase in forest fire
   emissions during this period is considered to be the most likely reason
   for this increase. Yangon and Mandalay showed contrasting trends for
   pollutants during the lockdown period. AOD and CO are decreased by 18%
   and 12% in Yangon. A small change (-1.2%) was observed for NO[2] over
   Yangon during the lockdown period compared to the pre-lockdown period.
   In contrast to other SA cities, only a small change in NO[2] level (-4
   to 3% in comparison with 5-year mean) was observed for Yangon
   (Kanniah et al., 2020). A 22% increase in AOD was observed over Kabul,
   which might have been due to increased particulate re suspension
   associated with dust transport in the pre-monsoon season. The selected
   industrial grid shows a decrease in levels of aerosol and gaseous
   pollutants as would be expected with reductions in industrial activity,
   combustion, heavy vehicle movement and lowering of coal-based power
   generation. This slowdown in industrial activity, limited vehicular
   movement and decreased power needs may have led to the 15% reduction in
   aerosol load and 12% reduction is NO[2] as observed during lockdown. An
   increase of 6% in CO levels over the same period could be the result of
   anecdotal reports of increased open burning. All the study cities
   except Dhaka and the industrial grid showed very low levels of SO[2]. A
   44% reduction in SO[2] was observed over Dhaka. SO[2] levels over the
   industrial grid were approximately 3-4 times greater than Dhaka and
   decreased by more than 50% during the lockdown period. A similar
   reduction of 17% for SO[2] was also reported over the identified power
   plant hot spot domain in east India during March compared to the 5 year
   mean SO[2] (Metya et al., 2020). The industrial cities of Karachi,
   Jamshedpur and Singrauli experienced 8.5%, 25.2% and 41.9% reductions
   in AOD (respectively) whereas Chattogram and Hetauda exhibited 40.5%
   and 3.3% increases in AOD (Table 6). Karachi and Jamshedpur experienced
   reductions in SO[2], NO[2] and CO, however Hetauda experienced
   increases in all the selected AQ parameters, which could be associated
   with increased forest fire activity in the region.

   Table 6. Percentage change in mean AOD, NO2, and CO during the lockdown
   period compared to their respective pre-lockdown period over select
   cities and the industrial grid based on satellite data. The final
   column shows the percentage change in PM2.5 during the lockdown period
   compared to pre-lockdown at the US embassy monitoring stations. The 95%
   confidence interval is given in parenthesis.

   In-situ observations of PM[2.5] from the US embassy monitoring stations
   suggest a substantial decrease at most of the sites except Kathmandu
   (Table 6 and S1). These stations are situated in big cities where the
   transport sector is a major source of air pollution. Comparison of mean
   PM[2.5] pre and during lockdown decreased by more than 50% over Kabul,
   Lahore, and Kolkata whereas over New Delhi and Dhaka a decrease of 35%
   and 39% respectively was observed. A reduction of over 50% in levels of
   particulate matter and considerable reduction in other pollutants were
   also reported from the CPCB, DPCC, and IITM observatories in New Delhi
   (CPCB, 2020; Mahato et al., 2020). The increase in PBL height over
   majority of the study domain during lockdown period compared to
   pre-lockdown might also be one of the reasons for decrease in surface
   PM[2.5] along with decrease in anthropogenic emission (Madineni et al.,
   2021; Zhang et al., 2021). A substantial decrease of 23% and 26% was
   observed in Islamabad and Yangon for PM[2.5]. At one of the two
   stations of Kathmandu almost no change was seen and at the other (Phora
   Durbar) a 25% increase in PM[2.5] was observed. The decrease in
   PM[2.5] observed at the Kabul monitoring station did not agree with the
   trend observed in MODIS columnar AOD but is consistent with the decline
   in anthropogenic activities. High dust emission in the pre-monsoon
   season might be the reason for increased columnar AOD over Kabul. While
   the rise in PM[2.5] at the US Embassy site in Kathmandu is consistent
   with forest fire activity (see Section 3.5). Similar results were also
   observed in studies performed over India and other major cities across
   SA (e.g., Kumar et al., 2020; Sharma et al., 2020a).


3.5 Mountain Region Analysis

   Over the northern mountainous regions of SA, there was an increase in
   reported AOD during the lockdown period when compared to pre-lockdown.
   In this section, in-situ PM[10] and PM[2.5] data from the Kathmandu and
   Kavre sites were used to further investigate this finding. Comparison
   of PM[10] data for both the sites (Fig. 5) showed much higher values
   (close to three times) at the Kathmandu site (69.7 ± 41.1 µg m^-^3)
   compared to the Kavre site (24.8 ± 10.2 µg m^-^3) in the pre-lockdown
   period. While during lockdown, the PM[10] concentration observed at
   Kathmandu site (37.3 ± 21.3 µg m^-^3) was only 15% higher than that of
   Kavre site (32.3 ± 37.3 µg m^-^3). This indicates that within the
   valley, a high concentration of PM[10] generally exists (attributed to
   sources like re-suspended dust and construction activities) that
   reduced by ~46% during lockdown versus pre-lockdown. Comparison of
   pre-monsoon PM[10] data from earlier study indicates an average of 241
   ± 134 µg m^-^3 over Kathmandu (Putero et al., 2015). These differences
   might exist due to the different pre-monsoon period definitions
   considered by Putero et al. (2015) that ranged from February to May and
   the location of the station. There are limited studies of
   PM[10] variation from within the valley with the notable exception of a
   study in 2008 (Aryal et al., 2008) which is not directly comparable due
   to the expansion of Kathmandu between 2008 and 2021.

   Fig. 5. Hourly variation in PM10 and PM2.5 during the pre-lockdown and
   lockdown periods at the Kathmandu (Ratnapark) and Kavre (Dhulikhel)
   sites. Daily variation in precipitation rate (Pcp) is shown by the grey
   line and the right hand Y-axis. Fig. 5. Hourly variation in PM[10] and
   PM[2.5] during the pre-lockdown and lockdown periods at the Kathmandu
   (Ratnapark) and Kavre (Dhulikhel) sites. Daily variation in
   precipitation rate (Pcp) is shown by the grey line and the right hand
   Y-axis.

   Comparison of PM[2.5] at both stations indicates that levels of
   PM[2.5] were ~55% higher at the Kathmandu site (35 ± 14 µg m^-^3)
   compared to the Kavre site (22.5 ± 8.7 µg m^-^3) during pre-lockdown.
   Similar values were also observed during studies from 2006-2007 but
   these comparisons are limited due to the age of these measurements
   (Aryal et al., 2009; Stone et al., 2010). Whereas the values at both
   the stations (33.2 ± 19.8 and 30.5 ± 18.6 µg m^-^3 for Kathmandu and
   Kavre sites respectively) were almost similar during the lockdown
   period. This indicates a stronger influence of sources such as
   transport, small scale industries and combustion within the valley
   region which then decreased during the lockdown period. However, a
   comparison of pre-lockdown and lockdown period PM[2.5] concentrations
   at both the stations indicate a gradual increase in
   PM[2.5] concentrations during the lockdown period reaching a maximum
   between the 5^th-15^th April 2020 followed by a rapid decline. This is
   contrary to findings from other studies on the impacts of lockdown on
   AQ (Collivignarelli et al., 2020; Mahato et al., 2020; Nakada and
   Urban, 2020; Sharma et al., 2020b). The gradual increase in
   PM[2.5] could be strongly attributed to the simultaneous increase in
   forest fires in the nearby regions. This was supported by the time
   series plot of fire spots acquired from MODIS (25-35°E Latitude and
   75-90°N longitude, i.e., encompassing the Kathmandu Valley, Fig. 6,
   bottom panel). During these events mean PM[2.5] concentrations were
   51.2 ± 18.8 µg m^-^3 and 49.5 ± 22.2 µg m^-^3 (reaching 80-100 µg m^-³
   for few days) respectively at Kavre and Kathmandu. Similar impacts of
   forest fires on the ambient AQ in the region (during different years)
   have been reported at other sites in Nepal (Mehra et al., 2019).
   Immediately after the forest fire events, increased rainfall events
   occurred over the study area which resulted in a rapid decline in PM
   levels associated with wet deposition. To study the effect of forest
   fires and rainfall on columnar aerosol loading over other locations in
   Nepal, AOD data from AERONET sites in Bidur, Pokhara, and Kyanging
   Gompa (Fig 6. Middle Panel) were also studied. Although these sites are
   geographically located in different ecosystems within Nepal, all
   indicated an increase in AOD values during forest fire events (along
   with increased PM[2.5] concentrations at the Ratnapark and Dhulikhel
   sites). There is evidence supporting the transport of emissions from
   forest fires up to the glaciers as high as 4000 masl in Nepal
   (Dhungel et al., 2018; Gul et al., 2021).

   Therefore, indicating that forest fire related emissions during this
   season plays an important role for high mountain regions in SA (which
   might have masked the effects of lockdown prompted emission reduction).


4 CONCLUSIONS
     __________________________________________________________________

   This study indicates that spatial means of AOD, columnar NO[2], and CO
   over SA during the defined lockdown period (25 March-30 April 2020)
   were 9.5%, 2.0%, and 2.6% higher than the pre-lockdown period (01
   March-20 March 2020) and with the exception of CO. This change observed
   for the year 2020 is slightly lower than the change observed in the
   previous years pre lockdown and lockdown period, that can be attributed
   to the overall reduction due to lockdown. Country-level analysis
   indicates that during the lockdown a decline in AOD was observed for
   India, Pakistan, Bangladesh (~14-18%) while an increase was observed
   over Myanmar (~40%) and other mountainous regions in the North (i.e.,
   Nepal). While for CO an increase in India, Bangladesh could be
   attributed to the effect of forest fires which dominated over the
   eastern region. NO[2] generally declined except for Pakistan where no
   change was observed. Satellite-based observations over country capitals
   indicate a mixed pattern of change but surface-based in-situ
   observation indicates an improvement in AQ (~20-60% PM[2.5] reduction)
   during the lockdown compared to the pre-lockdown phase. Overall, this
   study indicates that a reduction of vehicular and industrial emissions
   of the level seen during lockdown could lead to a reduction of fine
   particulate levels of approximately ~20-50% at the city level while on
   a regional scale that level of reduction might not be visible due to
   other strong contributing factors. Clearly reflecting the importance of
   other sources of emissions that are not directly linked to the large
   scale economic activity. This highlights the need for a more detailed
   understanding of the spatiotemporal distribution of sources in
   different seasons for the effective design and implementation of air
   quality mitigation strategies. This also emphasize for a renewed focus
   on mitigation activities at the household level that is potentially
   cost effective, efficient and long term in nature. This study
   demonstrates the need for evidence-based action as opposed to anecdotal
   evidence or assumptions regarding solutions being the same across the
   region (e.g., targeting transport only). Such actions need to be based
   on in-depth cost-benefit analysis considering the sectoral contribution
   of commercial and domestic activity regionally. This will help to
   quantify benefits and define efficient and cost-effective actions to
   improve the quality of the air that we breathe.

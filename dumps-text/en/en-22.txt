   in their backyard. One difficult call is whether to lockdown the
   facility, which can have emotional consequences.

   On the afternoon of Feb. 14, Fawn Patterson got a call from her
   daughter telling her to come to the hospital.

   Amanda Ray Carrillo was pregnant with her fifth child, and she was
   bleeding. She'd been admitted to Broward Health Medical Center in Ft.
   Lauderdale the day before but hadn't gotten answers yet about what was
   wrong. She wanted her mom to be there when the doctor came to explain.

   When Patterson got to the hospital, there was a security guard blocking
   the door. The facility was on lockdown after receiving several victims
   from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Earlier that day, a gunman
   had opened fire at the school â killing 17 people and injuring another
   17.

   "I have a daughter up there who is seven months pregnant, bleeding, and
   I can't get in to see her," Patterson said that afternoon, as she
   lingered on the sidewalk outside the emergency room. "If there's
   somebody up there that's worse off, and a family member would like to
   see them before something happens, nobody can get in."

   Patterson was one of dozens of family members and friends waiting
   outside the hospital to see loved ones who were being treated for
   medical concerns unrelated to the school shooting. At one point,
   hospital officials said the lockdown would be in place all night â
   although they ultimately lifted it after five hours.

   Better control

   Hospital administrators in Broward County â and around the country â
   said enhanced security protocols like lockdowns are standard when
   victims of violence are being treated. They argued it's necessary to
   keep all patients and staff safe.

   "In a time of crisis like this, it's better to have control over the
   situation," Dr. Louis Yogel, who was the chief of medical staff at the
   Ft. Lauderdale hospital, told reporters gathered there the night of the
   shooting. "You have better control when you control who is coming in
   and who is coming out."

   But hospital administrators recognize the indirect consequences of mass
   shootings â the far-reaching ripple effects on an entire community â
   like the distress people experience when they're separated from sick
   loved ones during a lockdown.

   "It's a real problem," said Alan Butler, president-elect of the
   International Association for Healthcare Security and Safety.

   "When you shut down access to a hospital, the people that you're
   keeping out are in this heightened emotional state," Butler said. "It's
   not uncommon for people to yell and be frustrated. We've seen scuffles
   in the parking lot."

   They're trying to fix it.

   Butler said hospitals around the country compare notes, reassessing
   their disaster response plans, after every mass shooting. That was
   especially true after a sniper killed 58 people and injured hundreds
   more at a country music festival in Las Vegas last October. People
   showed up at the city's hospitals not only in ambulances but also in
   cars and on foot. Some of the medical centers were not used to treating
   victims of severe trauma.

   One thing hospitals are considering is whether they're too aggressive
   about lockdowns, said Butler, who has been in the health care security
   business for two decades.

   "Sometimes, we stay in these elevated lockdown stages longer than we
   need to," he said.

   Hospitals are also lining up extra staff who they can call in
   specifically to deal with crowds: the people who are there because of
   an emergency and the visitors who would've been there anyway.

   Still, hospital security experts defend lockdowns as an important
   precautionary measure.

   As painful as lockdowns can be for family members, "our first and
   foremost responsibility is treating the patients, and that overrides
   everything," said Bryan Margeson, corporate security manager for
   Orlando Health. His private hospital chain treated victims of the Pulse
   nightclub shooting in June 2016.

   Margeson said when a mass casualty incident is the result of violence,
   hospital administrators worry about worst-case scenarios â such as a
   suspect coming to the hospital to further harm victims, someone trying
   to retaliate against a perpetrator or big crowds of people rushing
   emergency rooms.

   So when there's a crisis at his hospitals, security guards patrol the
   entrances, questioning people about why they need to come in. If
   they're not there for medical care, they're not a high priority.

   The emotional costs

   On Feb. 14, the day of the Parkland shooting, Fawn Patterson sat on a
   concrete block in the Fort Lauderdale hospital's parking lot. She was
   there with two other women who were also hoping to get in.

   Joedonna Harrison and Shoshanna Campbell were there to see a close
   friend and coworker who was suffering from cancer. Their friend had
   been told she didn't have much longer to live.

   "We grew up together," Harrison said of her friend, whose name she
   chose not to share. "She been there for me from day one. ... I come
   every day to see her."

   Campbell said she worried what might happen if she had to come back the
   next day.

   "If I don't get to see her today, I don't know if I'm gonna get to see
   her," she said.

   The lockdown began at around 4 p.m. A few hours into it, tensions were
   running high, and people were crowding the entrance of the emergency
   room trying to persuade staff to let them inside the hospital.

   "I have no words. I'm just lost," said Porcha McIntosh. She lives in
   New York but had been in South Florida visiting family when she gave
   birth prematurely on Dec. 29. Her newborn son, Calieb, was suffering
   from choanal atresia, which means his nasal passages weren't fully
   developed.

   She wouldn't budge from the door, in a near state of panic.

   "Anything that happens ... I have no way of knowing," she said. Her
   phone was dying.

   Ultimately, McIntosh was escorted into the hospital by a staff member
   and spent the night there with her son. He was released from the
   hospital about three months after his birth. Recently, she said he was
   doing better but was still breathing with a tube in his throat.

   By the time the lockdown lifted at 9 p.m. on Feb. 14, Fawn Patterson
   had already gone home.

   Amanda Ray Carrillo's complications with her pregnancy turned out to be
   not too serious. She was treated and released from the hospital the day
   after the shooting.

   Two months later, she was back â to have her fifth child. Amaya
   Gonzalez was born on April 16 â eight pounds, 13 ounces, and 21 inches
   long.

   "She's beautiful. She's a perfect little girl," Carrillo said in her
   hospital room a few hours after the birth. "We're so excited."

   This time, her mom was by her bedside.

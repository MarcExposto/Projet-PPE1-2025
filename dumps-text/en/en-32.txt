   A Scottish soldier has told how he has drawn from his experience of
   being in war zones in Afghanistan to get through the coronavirus
   lockdown.

   Corporal Alan Fergusson said it was not alien for him to live in a
   small space without being allowed to leave and said he was used to
   being in "unpleasant situations".

   The 38-year-old from 2 SCOTS said people should not be scared of
   coronavirus but instead respect it.

   He said: "You can't live in fear. In this lockdown people need to take
   every day as it comes and realise there is an end point.

   "This lockdown will not last forever so people need to pick something
   they plan to do at the end and focus on that to get them through.

   "I'm focusing on our next deployment to Afghanistan in October as mine.

   "You also have to focus on the little victories you have each day and
   find a hobby you like doing until the lockdown is lifted.

   "I had a terrifying job in Afghanistan and how I made it through each
   day was thinking each night when I was in bed that nobody had died or
   been hurt so it had been a good day. I took it one day at a time."

   Corporal Alan Fergusson can only train half the numbers due to social
   distancing rules under lockdown

   When Corporal Fergusson is in a war zone such as Afghanistan he only
   has a house with a small garden to live in for two months with all the
   other soldiers.

   He said: "The lockdown is comparable to operations when we're in
   Afghanistan because there are 40 soldiers in a little compound 100m sq
   and we can't leave or we will be shot.

   "Being in lockdown therefore is not alien to the guys who have been on
   operations and in Iraq the platoon houses are even smaller.

   "So being in a small space is not alien to us.

   "In this lockdown it is hard to see an end point because of the fog of
   covid but it is there and it will end."

   Corporal Fergusson, who has been a Royal Army Medical Corp combat
   medical technician attached to the Second Battalion Royal regiment of
   Scotland for 10 years, lives in Glencorse Army Barracks in Penicuik in
   Midlothian.

   He is originally from Lanarkshire.

   He said living in the Army barracks was very different now.

   He said: "We are all socially distancing, the parades have finished and
   our commanding officer is now disseminating commands electronically to
   our phones.

   "Our commanding officer would normally address us in the parade square
   to us in lines, however that isn't happening any more."

   There are eight men to a flat but they all have their own rooms and
   en-suites.

   There are queues for the cook house now and all the chairs have been
   moved so they have 2m (6ft) spacing.

   He said: "I don't feel lonely because I can still see people and there
   is still the camaraderie and we have Afghanistan to work towards so we
   have the push.

   "Soldiers are remarkably good at adapting and taking it on the chin and
   use dark humour when in any unpleasant situations.

   "But we are also already used to structures in our lives so that has
   helped with these new measures.

   "We are also quite good at doing what we are told."

   Corporal Fergusson said: "People need to remember nothing lasts
   forever, we just have to ride out the bad times while they're here and
   appreciate the good times while we can. There are always more of both
   to follow."

   Israeli forces have carried out mass arrests and forced dozens of
   families from their homes in the town of Qabatiya in the occupied West
   Bank, on the second day of a sweeping military operation ordered by
   Israel's defence minister.

   Israeli forces sealed off entrances to Qabatiya while rounding up and
   interrogating dozens of residents on Saturday, local sources told Al
   Jazeera. They converted several homes into military interrogation
   centres, displacing their occupants, according to the Palestinian Wafa
   news agency.

   The Israeli army confirmed the operation on Saturday, with Defence
   Minister Israel Katz saying in a statement that they had imposed "a
   lockdown and a complete cordon" around Qabatiya.

   Earlier Israel's Army Radio reported that the town is subject to a
   "full curfew".

   The crackdown follows an order by Katz to "act forcefully ... against
   the village of Qabatiya", where he claims a Palestinian alleged of
   carrying out a stabbing and car-ramming attack in northern Israel hails
   from.

   In a statement on Friday, Israel's military said it had deployed troops
   from multiple divisions, along with border police and members of the
   Shin Bet security service, into Qabatiya. It said forces had raided the
   attack suspect's home and were preparing to demolish it.

   Rights groups have long condemned Israel's practice of demolishing the
   family homes of Palestinians accused of attacks against Israelis,
   describing it as an illegal form of collective punishment.

   Israel's military claimed its forces would "scan additional locations
   in the village" and "work to arrest wanted individuals and locate
   weapons".

   "There is a sense of fear among people in town," one resident told Al
   Jazeera. "There are Israeli threats and Israeli incitement."

   The Israeli military raids on Saturday also extended elsewhere in the
   occupied West Bank, including to several villages surrounding Ramallah
   and Hebron, Wafa reported. Israeli forces assaulted and arrested eight
   people from the towns of Dura, Abda and Imreish near Hebron, according
   to the news agency.

   Israeli military incursions and attacks across the occupied West Bank
   have been a near-daily occurrence during Israel's genocidal war on
   Gaza.

   Since October 7, 2023, Israeli authorities have arrested nearly 21,000
   Palestinians. As of December 1, some 9,300 Palestinian prisoners were
   in Israeli jails, more than a third of them detained without charges.

   Palestinian prisoners have been tortured, sexually abused and even
   killed in custody.

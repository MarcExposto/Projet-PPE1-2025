Spain's death toll hit 10,000 after record 950 new deaths recorded in last 24
hours

   More than 3.9 billion people, or half of the world's population, have
   now been asked or ordered to stay at home by their governments to
   prevent the spread of the deadly COVID-19 virus.

   Data from an AFP database collated compulsory or recommended
   confinements, curfews and quarantines in more than 90 countries or
   territories.

   Due to the introduction of a curfew in Thailand (effective from
   Friday), the threshold of 50% of humanity will be reached.

   Meanwhile, the number of dead in Spain from coronavirus has now risen
   above 10,000, according to the latest health authority figures
   published on Thursday.

   It's a new record for the country, with 950 deaths in the last 24
   hours.

   The total number of deaths stands at 10,003, with a total of 110,238
   confirmed cases in Europe's worst affected nation after Italy.

   However, the infection rate appeared to ease. Health authorities say
   contagion in Spain has dropped from a daily average of 20% until March
   25 to less than 12% after that date, more than 10 days after Spaniards
   were ordered to stay home.

   But the government has acknowledged that the real number of infections
   could be much higher due to limited testing.

   The figures also show that more people are recovering. The total now
   stands at 26,743 in Spain -- up from 22,647 the previous day. That
   number represents more than 20% of the overall number of cases.

   There were reasons for optimism from Italy, too, late on Thursday
   afternoon. The number of new infections continues to fall, down to
   4668, a slight fall on Wednesday's figures, and a drop of 1,500
   compared with a week ago.

   Italy's daily death toll was 760, a slight increase against yesterday,
   but down from the more than 9,000 fatalities announced last Friday.

Unemployment soars

   Spain also reported catastrophic unemployment figures on Thursday,
   evidence of the devastating effect the pandemic is having on the
   economy. Jobless numbers rose by over 300,000 in March, the highest
   increase on record, Euronews' Spanish service reports.

   The number of people out of work has risen far more sharply than
   happened during the financial crisis of 2008, Spanish media say.

   The European Union has designed a new programme to raise up to EUR100
   billion to tackle surging unemployment brought on by the pandemic.

   The aim of the scheme, called SURE, is to provide financial assistance
   to the 27 member states via loans from the EU. "Only the strongest of
   responses will do," European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen
   said in Brussels on Thursday.

   In the US new Labor Department figures showed that more than 6.6
   million Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week --
   doubling a record high set just a week earlier.

Also around Europe:

     * In Greece, authorities placed an entire refugee camp under
       quarantine Thursday after discovering that a third of the 63
       contacts of an infected woman tested positive for the virus -- and
       none showed symptoms.
     * In the UK, another 569 people died of coronavirus, bringing the
       total number of deaths to 2,921. As on Wednesday, it is the biggest
       daily increase in the UK so far.
     * 14 EU states have signed a joint declaration warning of the danger
       of violations to the rule of law, AFP reports. EU Commission
       President Ursula von der Leyen said on Thursday she was
       "particularly concerned about the situation in Hungary," where
       Prime Minister Viktor Orban has been granted sweeping new powers.
     * The European Commission chief apologised to Italy for the lack of
       EU solidarity during the pandemic but stopped short of granting
       Rome's request for 'corona bonds'.

   "Today Europe is mobilising alongside Italy. Unfortunately, this has
   not always been the case," Ursula von der Leyen wrote in Italy''s La
   Repubblica newspaper.
     * A French medicine watchdog has warned of the dangerous side effects
       of malaria and HIV drugs being tested against the novel
       coronavirus.
     * The British comedian Eddie Large has died aged 78 after contracting

Race to secure medical supplies

   Governments are racing to buy medical equipment including protective
   gear as a debate intensifies over providing adequate testing, when it's
   advisable to wear masks, and whether stricter lockdowns should be
   imposed.

   In the worst-affected countries health resources are being massively
   stretched. Some in Europe have called in medical students, retired
   doctors and even laid-off flight attendants with first aid training to
   help.

   The situation has been exacerbated by medical staff becoming infected
   themselves. In Italy alone, nearly 10,000 medical workers have
   contracted the virus and more than 60 doctors have died.

   Research from Singapore is the latest to suggest that around 10% of
   infections may be spread by people who carry the virus but do not yet
   show symptoms, AP reports. The US Centers for Disease Control and
   Prevention has updated its advice to Americans on the risk of
   infection, essentially warning that anyone may be a carrier.

   President Trump has admitted that stocks of protective gear are
   depleted in the US, where over 5,000 deaths and more than 200,000
   infections have been reported.

   The number of worldwide cases rose above 900,000 on Wednesday, the
   World Health Organisation (WHO) said. The United Nations has warned
   that the world faces its worst crisis since the Second World War.

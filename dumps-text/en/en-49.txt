Lockdown has forced people to live for longer in unsuitable housing

   24 November 2020

   During the coronavirus pandemic much of the population have been
   âstaying home to save livesâ, but this has meant many people have been
   stuck living in poor housing conditions
   house

   According to the latest housing report from the Resolution Foundation,
   which used Understanding Societyâs COVID-19 data, â age, income and
   ethnicity affected the quality of homes that people have been occupying
   during lockdown.

Key findings

     * Younger age groups have spent lockdown in considerably poorer
       housing conditions than those in older age brackets. Young people
       have less space, are more likely to live in a damp home,  are more
       likely to have no garden, or to live in a derelict or congested
       neighbourhood than older generations.
     * Within age groups, income and ethnicity are strongly corelated with
       housing quality. The average low-income 55-64-year-old is more
       likely to contend with damp, or to live in a problematic
       neighbourhood, than the average 25-34-year-old in the highest
       income bracket. And on average, those aged 55 and older from BAME
       backgrounds occupy homes with 30 percent less useable space than
       their white counterparts.
     * One-in-five children from a low-income household has spent lockdown
       in an overcrowded home, while close to 10 percent are growing up in
       damp conditions. Nearly 40 percent of under-16s from BAME groups
       have no obvious garden, and one-quarter live in an objectively
       poor-quality environment.
     * While housing quality has generally improved over time,
       overcrowding has increased. This is an especially pronounced
       problem for those with dependent children.
     * The private-rented sector (PRS) is the tenure with the poorest
       record on damp (8 percent of properties), while the social-rented
       sector contains the largest proportion of households living in
       overcrowded conditions (16 percent). The structural shift, whereby
       many more young people and families with children live in the PRS
       today than in the past, has played a large role in widening
       intergenerational gaps in living conditions.

   Housing conditions have had a stronger effect on well-being during the
   pandemic. Even after controlling for key characteristics such as pay
   and relationship status, the well-being gap between renters and owners
   has widened over the lockdown period.

   The researchers said in the report, âDecent living conditions are not
   just a ânice to haveâ: they have a profound influence on outcomes
   including well-being, an effect this note shows has been amplified
   during the lockdown period. Moreover, the inequalities in living
   conditions we document here are far from natural. Instead, they are the
   product of long-run housing trends such as tenure change, lack of
   building and insufficient regulation of privately rented homes.â

   Empty central London Carnaby Street taken during COVID-19 lockdown


   Since the UK first entered lockdown on March 23 2020, little in the
   pandemic has attracted so much attention and controversy as this
   decision to grind social and economic life to a halt. Was it the right
   thing to do?

   Properly evaluating the effectiveness of any health-oriented treatment,
   be it a new medicine, vaccine or lockdown measure, involves comparing
   its introduction with a counterfactual situation where everything is
   the same except for whatâs being tested. This is why medical trials
   have a control group, whose members are given a placebo and whose
   characteristics match the testing group as closely as possible.

   Unfortunately, this isnât possible for lockdowns. There are no directly
   equivalent parts of a country or the world that can act as true test
   and control groups, and so no possibility of a controlled trial.
   Instead, researchers must resort to other methods to try to measure
   lockdownsâ effects.

   Mathematical models can be used to produce âwhat ifâ scenarios, where
   applying various different COVID control measures is simulated to
   estimate what would work best, essentially comparing the value of
   lockdown to other measures â or doing nothing at all. Such models are
   very useful and have been used throughout the pandemic.

   However, theyâve also been heavily criticised for their pessimistic
   predictions about the impact of the virus. Their outputs depend on
   making assumptions and estimates, including about human behaviour,
   which is notoriously difficult to capture accurately.

   An alternative is to use a data-driven method that doesnât rely so
   strongly on the assumptions of models. For example, the
   âdifference-in-differenceâ method compares outcomes from countries or
   regions that are similar in all respects except the implemented control
   measures. A common approach has been to compare data from US states
   that differed in the stringency, timing and extent of their control
   measures but otherwise share many characteristics.

   But of course, this runs into our initial problem. While often similar,
   no two states arenât directly comparable. And for other countries, like
   the UK, its even more difficult to find good pairings for comparison.

Imperfect assessments, clear results

   Despite these difficulties, a lot of researchers have worked to try to
   analyse the impact of lockdowns. While accepting that no method of
   assessment is perfect, most published studies have found evidence to
   support lockdown measures being effective. They also point out that
   different actions achieved different things in different countries.
   Graph showing the impact of various control measures on reducing new
   infections Estimates of the effects of different control measures on
   the number of new COVID infections during the first epidemic wave. The
   different dots represent different ways of modelling the effects of
   control measures â showing that how you choose to measure impact does
   make a difference. Banholzer N et al. 2021. PLOS ONE 16, e0252827, CC
   BY

   Limiting gatherings, closing businesses with high exposure rates, and
   closing schools and universities effectively reduced the spread and
   limited deaths. These places are associated with increased transmission
   rates and superspreader events.

Have you read?

     * COVID-19 survivors are still at greater risk of heart attacks a
       year after infection
     * How a mix-and-match vaccine approach could boost immunity to
       COVID-19
     * Why donât most people with COVID need to test for another 30 days,
       even if theyâre re-exposed?

   But perhaps surprisingly, stay-at-home orders appear to have had only a
   modest effect in slowing transmission. This may, though, be down to
   people already limiting their activities voluntarily before being told
   to do so. Closing airports somewhat limits the disease impact, but land
   borders much less.

The danger of delaying

   So, were lockdowns appropriate strategy, or should governments in
   future rely purely on voluntary isolation? Or is the best response to
   do nothing?

   In evaluating the 2020 lockdowns, we need to remember that the
   decisions were taken with high uncertainty of what the consequences
   could be. It is easy to criticise the scientists and politicians in
   hindsight, but under the precautionary principle, the strongest
   possible measures should have been applied given the unknowns that were
   being faced.

   Despite substantial variability across countries, thereâs little doubt
   that lockdowns successfully slowed COVIDâs spread in spring 2020,
   reducing cases in the first wave. Thereâs enough evidence to show that
   countries and regions that quickly introduced substantial and multiple
   restrictions also had fewer cases and deaths. Compare New Zealandâs and
   the UKâs responses.
   Graph showing how New Zealeand introduced stricter control measures
   quicker in spring 2020 compared to the UK, and suffered fewer cases and
   deaths as a result New Zealand locked down quicker and more forcefully
   in the spring of 2020 â resulting in fewer cases and deaths. The
   strength of lockdown restrictions is measured using the COVID response
   stringency index developed by the University of Oxford; peopleâs
   mobility is measured via anonymously collected data from mobile
   devices. Adam Kleczkowski

   In both cases the introduction of lockdown regulations (first graph
   above) resulted in a rapid drop in mobility (second graph above).
   Reported cases peak soon after. Deaths in turn took another week or two
   to respond.

   But New Zealand responded very quickly to its first reported case, with
   its lockdown introduced well before the first death in the country. Its
   resulting case numbers and deaths were low. In contrast, the UK delayed
   its lockdown response until almost two weeks after its first death.

   Although British people reduced their mobility before lockdown was
   officially introduced, the virus had ample time to spread. The fact
   that delaying lockdown had such a large impact is further proof of its
   power to control the spread of the virus.

Lessons for the future

   Should the world face another new pandemic disease, there are three
   lessons to keep in mind. Firstly, applying protective measures as early
   and hard as possible consistently led to better outcomes. Less
   stringent interventions risked increasing deaths; more severe responses
   lowered fatalities.

   Plus, unless itâs possible to eliminate the virus in a region, measures
   will need to continue. This requires public acceptance and economic
   support, particularly in areas of high deprivation. And finally, for
   the greatest effect, different restrictions must be combined, including
   voluntary responses â such as social distancing â and test and trace.
   Thereâs no single silver bullet. Some measures might need maintaining,
   even after, for example, introducing vaccines.

   The 2020 lockdowns demonstrated that societies are willing and capable
   of supporting drastic disease-control measures if they see the need.
   But, full â and particularly repeated â lockdowns can be seen as a
   failure of other, more gradual public health policies. A lockdown
   should be seen as an efficient but also very blunt public health tool,
   to be used in necessity but as part of a wider strategy. The

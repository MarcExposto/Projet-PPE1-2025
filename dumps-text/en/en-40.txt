Lockdown could have been avoided - key findings from Covid inquiry

   The long-awaited independent report into how well or badly the
   government handled the Covid pandemic has been published.

   Chairwoman of the inquiry, former judge Baroness Hallett, said the UK's
   response could be summarised as "too little, too late".

   The report looks at whether lockdowns were timely and reasonable, and
   what impact rule-breaking at the heart of government had on public
   confidence.

   Here are some of the main findings.

Lockdown could have been avoided completely

   The report says lockdown could have been avoided if steps such as
   social distancing and isolating those with symptoms along with members
   of their household had been introduced earlier than mid-March 2020.

   But by the time ministers took action it was already too late and a
   lockdown was inevitable, it says.

   By the end of January 2020 it "should have been clear that the virus
   posed a serious and immediate threat", while February 2020 was "a lost
   month" and the lack of urgency overall in government was "inexcusable",
   the inquiry found.

   Voluntary measures were brought in on 16 March 2020, followed by the
   full stay-at home lockdown seven days later.

But lockdown a week earlier could have saved thousands of lives

   Bringing in lockdown a week earlier on 16 March would have meant 23,000
   fewer deaths in England in the first wave, modelling suggests. This
   would have equated to 48% fewer deaths in the first wave.

   But the report does not suggest the overall death toll for the pandemic
   - 227,000 in the UK by the time it was declared over in 2023 - would
   have been reduced by an earlier lockdown.

   That is very difficult to tell, as it depends on a variety of other
   factors that could have reduced or increased the number of deaths as
   the pandemic progressed.

UK did 'too little, too late', leading to thousands more Covid deaths, says
inquiry

'Chaotic' UK government with key figures criticised

   The report describes a "toxic and chaotic" culture at the heart of the
   UK government during its response to the pandemic, which it said
   affected the quality of advice and decision-making.

   While it says poor behaviour was displayed by a number of senior
   leaders and advisers, Boris Johnson's chief adviser, Dominic Cummings
   is described as having been a "destabilising influence".

   It says his actions contributed "significantly to a culture of fear,
   mutual suspicion and distrust that poisoned the atmosphere in 10
   Downing Street".

   Dominic Cummings was Johnson's chief adviser until he resigned in
   November 2020

   The then-PM Johnson is also criticised for excessive optimism in the
   face of the looming pandemic and "oscillation" on key lockdown
   decisions.

   The report says Johnson "should have appreciated sooner that this was
   an emergency that required prime ministerial leadership to inject
   urgency into the response".

   Instead, he failed to appreciate the urgency of the situation "due to
   his optimism it would amount to nothing", it says.

   Meanwhile, his health secretary, Matt Hancock, is accused by Baroness
   Hallett of not being "candid" enough about the UK's ability to deal
   with the virus.

Lockdowns left 'lasting scars'

   While the lockdowns of 2020 and 2021 undoubtedly saved lives, they also
   "left lasting scars on society and the economy, brought ordinary
   childhood to a halt, delayed the diagnosis and treatment of other
   health issues and exacerbated societal inequalities", it says.

   Children were not prioritised enough, with ministers failing to
   consider properly the consequences of school closures, the report says.

   It says the vast majority of children were not at risk of serious
   direct harm from Covid "but suffered greatly from the closure of
   schools and requirement to stay at home".

   None of the UK's four nations were adequately prepared for the sudden
   and enormous task of educating most children in their homes, the
   inquiry adds.

Politicians breaking rules undermined public confidence

   Johnson has been criticised in the inquiry's report

   The report says that rule-breaking by politicians and their advisers
   undermined public confidence in decision-making and significantly
   increased the risk that people wouldn't stick to the measures being put
   in place.

   It lists events such as Cummings' trip to Durham and Barnard Castle in
   March 2020; two visits to a second home during lockdown by the chief
   medical officer for Scotland, Dr Catherine Calderwood; and visits to
   the home of scientific adviser Prof Neil Ferguson by a woman with whom
   he was in relationship during lockdown.

   By the time details of parties and social events in Downing Street
   emerged in November 2021, there was a "public outcry", the report says.

   Johnson and Rishi Sunak subsequently received fixed penalty notices for
   their actions.

Devolved governments relied too much on UK

   All four nations were criticised for their planning and
   decision-making, which the inquiry says was hampered by the lack of
   trust between Boris Johnson and the first ministers

   The inquiry found that at the start of 2020, while all four nations
   lacked urgency in their response, the devolved administrations were
   overly reliant on the UK government to lead the response.

   The four nations then differed in their strategy for exiting the first
   national lockdown, with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland adopting a
   more cautious approach - but this was undermined by no restrictions on
   travel from England, where many restrictions had been eased.

   The report finds that in Autumn 2020, Holyrood was the only government
   to learn lessons from the first lockdown, and introduced tough,
   locally-targeted measures which helped avoid the need for a nationwide
   lockdown.

   On the other hand, decision-making in Northern Ireland was described as
   "chaotic", while the Welsh government's approach resulted in the
   highest age-standardised mortality rate of the four nations between
   August and December 2020.

Scotland: Sturgeon excluded ministers from Covid decisions, inquiry says

Wales: Early Covid response 'inadequate', report finds

Northern Ireland: Covid decision-making was 'chaotic', says inquiry

How could the UK have done better?

   The report gives a long list of recommendations, including:
     * To establish structures to improve communication between the four
       nations during an emergency
     * Improve consideration of the impact decisions might have on people
       - both by the illness and the steps taken to respond to it
     * Create expert groups to advise on economic and social implications,
       not just the science
     * Ensure decisions - and their implications - are clearly
       communicated to the public
     * Enable greater parliamentary scrutiny of emergency powers

   The government doesn't have to adopt the inquiry's recommendations, but
   it must respond to them, which could shape future policies.

   The inquiry has already reported back on Britain's preparedness for the
   pandemic, concluding that the UK failed citizens with flawed plans.

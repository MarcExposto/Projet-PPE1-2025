   Following the Pahalgam terrorist attack on 22 April 2025, a crisis
   emerged between India and Pakistan,^[4] sparked by the killing of 26
   tourists by the militants in Kashmir. The Resistance Front (TRF)
   initially claimed responsibility for the attack.^[10]^[11] Armed
   skirmishes between India and Pakistan were reported along the Line of
   Control (LoC) beginning on 24 April. On 7 May 2025, India launched
   missile strikes in Pakistan, leading to a military conflict between the
   two countries. On 7 May 2025 Pakistan's Army responded by launching a
   blitz on Poonch, Jammu killing 16 civilians and leaving hundreds of
   homes destroyed.^[12]^[13] A ceasefire was announced on 10 May 2025
   following an agreement between India and Pakistan.^[14]

   The crisis emerged between the two countries after the Pahalgam
   terrorist attack, as India accused Pakistan of sponsoring the
   militants, leading Pakistan to deny its involvement and state they
   would be willing to cooperate with an international inquiry.^[15] India
   responded to the attack by expelling Pakistani diplomats, recalling its
   diplomatic staff, cutting off visa services, and suspending the Indus
   Waters Treaty.^[1] Pakistan initially responded with trade
   restrictions, closure of airspace and border crossings, and suspension
   of the Shimla Agreement.^[4] Between 24 April and 6 May, Pakistan and
   India engaged in skirmishes including cross-border firing and
   intermittent artillery shelling.^[16]

   On 7 May 2025, India launched missile strikes on Pakistan, codenamed
   Operation Sindoor. According to India, the missile strikes targeted the
   militant groups Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba. According to
   Pakistan, the Indian strikes targeted civilian areas, including
   mosques, killing 31 Pakistani civilians. In return, said they had
   downed a number of Indian jets and damaged Indian infrastructure. It
   was believed to be the heaviest shelling attack since the
   Indo-Pakistani war of 1971.^[17] On early 10 May 2025, Pakistan
   launched their retaliatory operation codenamed Operation
   Bunyan-um-Marsoos and military hostilities continued until a ceasefire
   was reached on late 10 May 2025.^[18]

Background

   Main article: 2025 Pahalgam attack

   An Islamist armed insurgency broke out in Jammu and Kashmir in the late
   1980s, which resulted in the exodus of Kashmiri Hindus from the region
   and the insurgency has been ongoing since.^[19]

   On 22 April 2025, a terrorist^[20]^[21]^[22] attack at Baisaran Valley
   near Pahalgam in the Anantnag district of Indian-administered Jammu and
   Kashmir killed at least 26 tourists and injured more than 20
   others.^[23]^[24] According to eyewitness testimonies provided to
   Indian media outlets, assailants reportedly questioned potential
   victims about their religious identity before opening fire,
   specifically targeting non-Muslims.^[25] All tourists killed were
   Hindus,^[26] except for one identified as a Christian.^[27]^[28]

   The attack became among the deadliest attacks against Indian civilians
   in the region since 2000. The Resistance Front (TRF), believed to be an
   offshoot of the Pakistan-based, UN-designated terrorist group
   Lashkar-e-Taiba,^[11]^[29]^[10] initially claimed responsibility. They
   stated that the attack was in opposition to Indian government policy
   allowing Indian citizens to live and work in Kashmir, resulting in
   non-local settlement in the region.^[30]^[29] Four days later, they
   retracted their claim.^[31]

Diplomatic crisis

   On the night of 23 April 2025, the Indian foreign secretary Vikram
   Misri held a special press briefing after a meeting with the CCS. He
   announced India's decision to temporarily suspend the Indus Waters
   Treaty with Pakistan with immediate effect until Pakistan ceases its
   support for cross-border terrorism.^[32] He further announced the
   closure of the integrated check post at Attari-Wagah Border, a travel
   ban for all Pakistani nationals to India under the SAARC Visa Exemption
   Scheme, and cancellation of all previously issued visas. Additionally,
   Pakistani military advisers at the Pakistan High Commission in New
   Delhi were expelled, while their Indian counterparts in Islamabad were
   withdrawn, and the staff strength of the Indian High Commission in
   Islamabad was reduced from 55 to a minimum of 30. The posts of such
   military advisors were deemed abolished.^[33]^[34]

   Pakistan's foreign ministry expressed condolences to the families of
   the victims,^[35] and its defense minister, Khawaja Asif, dismissed the
   allegations of his country's involvement in the attack and regarded
   such events as revolutions.^[36]^[37] However, in an interview with Sky
   News, while responding to allegations of terrorism, Asif said that
   Pakistan had backed terrorist activities at the direction of United
   States, Britain and the West going back three decades.^[38]^[39]

   Pakistan responded to the suspension of the treaty by describing it as
   inappropriate and lacking seriousness.^[40] Pakistan also warned India
   of a comprehensive retaliation in response to the actions announced by
   the Indian government in the aftermath of the incident,^[41] further
   stating that any action affecting water resources would be considered
   an act of war.^[42]^[43] On 24 April, Pakistan suspended visas issued
   to Indian nationals and closed its airspace to Indian aircraft,
   expelled Indian diplomats and instructed Indian military advisers to
   depart the country no later than the 30 April.^[44] However, the
   Kartarpur Corridor remained open for Sikh pilgrims.^[45] Pakistan also
   cut off all trade with India.^[46] Pakistan also suspended the Simla
   Agreement, on 24 April 2025 in retaliation.^[47]^[48] The Attari-Wagah
   border ceremony was also reduced and the symbolic handshake did not
   take place.^[49]^[50] Cross-border families were affected where their
   visas revoked.^[51]^[52]^[53]^[54]^[55]

   A joint cordon and search operation was initiated by the Indian Army,
   paramilitary forces, and Jammu and Kashmir Police. A temporary lockdown
   was imposed in Pahalgam, and Indian Army helicopters were deployed to
   track down the militants, who reportedly fled to the upper reaches of
   the Pir Panjal range.^[56]^[57] On 25 April, soldiers demolished the
   family residences of two individuals suspected of involvement in the
   Pahalgam attack.^[25] An Indian soldier was killed and two other
   soldiers wounded during a gunfight with insurgents in the Basantgarh
   region of Udhampur.^[58] Senior Lashkar-e-Taiba Commander Altaf Lalli
   was also killed in the gunfight.^[59]

   Both Pakistani and Indian air forces conducted intensive flights near
   the LoC.^[60] An Indian Border Security Force soldier belonging to the
   182nd battalion of the BSF was captured by Pakistan Rangers after he
   accidentally entered the Pakistani side of the Ferozepur
   border.^[61]^[62]^[63]

   Also on 24 April, the Indian XV Corps reported that it had thwarted an
   infiltration attempt by insurgents near Uri and killed 2
   insurgents.^[64]

   Between 24 April and 5 May, Indian and Pakistani army engaged in
   skirmishes and exchanged small arms firing.^[25]^[65]^[66]^[16]^[67]
   Reportedly, Pakistan's army initiated small arms firing across various
   sectors along the LoC,^[68] which was described as "unprovoked" by
   Indian media.^[69]^[70]^[71] The Pakistani army stated it shot down two
   Indian military quadcopter drones along the LoC in the Satwal sector
   and in the Manawar sector of Bhimber district.^[72]^[73]^[74]^[75]

   On 28 April, Pakistani Defense Minister Asif stated that an attack from
   the Indian armed forces was "imminent".^[76] On 30 April, Pakistan
   claimed it has "credible intelligence" that India is going to launch
   military action within several hours.^[77] On the night of 29 April,
   Pakistani forces opened fire on the international border along
   Kashmir.^[78]^[79] On 1 May, Indian Home Minister Amit Shah said that
   no terrorist involved in the attack would be spared by India.^[80]

   On 3 May, a soldier from the Pakistan Rangers was captured by BSF after
   crossing the border to India.^[81]

   On 5 May, the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs announced an "effective
   civil defence in the event of a hostile attack" on 7 May across 7
   states. Such drills were last conducted by India during 1971. As per
   reports, the drill includes operationalisation of Air Raid Warning
   Sirens, crash blackout measures, training of civilians on civil defence
   and evacuation plans.^[82]^[83]

Release of river water

   Following the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960 on 23 April
   2025, local media in Muzaffarabad, Pakistan, reported on 26 and 27
   April that India had released water from the Uri Dam into the Jhelum
   River unannounced, resulting in flooding.^[84]^[85] Additional reports
   indicated a sharp decline in water levels of the Chenab River in
   Sialkot, Pakistan, with satellite imagery showing significant drying of
   the riverbed.^[86] On 4 May 2025, India had closed the Baglihar Dam on
   the Chenab River and was planning a similar move at the Kishanganga Dam
   on the Neelum River.^[87]^[88]

Missile strikes and escalation

   Main article: 2025 India-Pakistan conflict

   On the night of 6/7 May, India launched "Operation Sindoor", striking
   what it described as "terrorist infrastructure" in Pakistan.^[89] The
   operation lasted 23 minutes and consisted of missile strikes by IAF
   jets. Rajnath Singh, Minister of Defence (India), said on 8 May that at
   least 100 militants had been killed in the strikes.^[90]

   According to India, the missile strikes of Operation Sindoor targeted
   the camps and infrastructure of militant groups Jaish-e-Mohammed and
   Lashkar-e-Taiba, and no Pakistani military facilities were targeted.
   According to Pakistan, the Indian strikes targeted civilian areas,
   including mosques, killing 31 Pakistani civilians. Following these
   strikes, border skirmishes and drone strikes occurred between the two
   countries. Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Maulana Masood Azhar accepted that 10
   members of his family and four of his aides were killed in India's
   airstrikes on the group's headquarters at the Jamia Masjid Subhan Allah
   in Bahawalpur.^[91]

   On 7 May, Pakistan's army launched mortar shells on the border district
   of Poonch in the Hindu-majority Jammu region.^[92] It was considered
   the worst shelling attack of the ongoing armed conflict in over 50
   years, and the heaviest shelling attack since the Indo-Pakistani war of
   1971.^[17] Indian sources claimed it killed one Indian soldier, 16
   civilians, including 12-year-old twins, and leaving 43 wounded,^[12]
   and destroyed 31 schools,^[13]^[12] hundreds of homes, and a Sikh
   temple and its ragi.^[13]^[92]

   In retaliation, on 10 May, Pakistan launched an operation codenamed
   "Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos" targeting several Indian military
   bases.^[93] India also continued Operation Sindoor, expanding its scope
   to target Pakistani military installations.^[94] This conflict marked
   the first drone battle between the two nuclear-armed nations.^[95]

Ceasefire

   After three days of the conflict, both India and Pakistan announced
   that a ceasefire was agreed, effective from 5:00 pm IST/04:30 pm PKT
   (11:30 UTC) on 10 May, with talks set for 12 May.^[96]^[97] Following
   the deadline, both countries accused each other of violating the
   ceasefire agreement.^[98]

Reactions

   Further information: 2025 Pahalgam attack § Reactions

United Nations

   The United Nations urged both sides to have "maximum restraint" and to
   resolve the issues diplomatically.^[99]

Iran

   On 25 April, the Islamic Republic of Iran proposed to mediate a
   solution aiming at de-escalation between Pakistan and India.^[100]

Russia

   Russia issued a travel advisory in April 2025, warning its citizens
   against traveling to Pakistan following the Pahalgam attack in Jammu
   and Kashmir. The advisory cited increased security risks in the
   region.^[101]

United States

   The U.S. State Department updated its travel advisory, issuing a Level
   4 "Do Not Travel" warning for India's Jammu and Kashmir, citing high
   risks of terrorism and civil unrest.^[102] Additionally, the U.S.
   Embassy in New Delhi confirmed it is closely monitoring the situation
   and called for the perpetrators to be brought to justice, reaffirming
   its support for India's counterterrorism efforts.^[103]^[104] On 26
   April 2025, President Donald Trump downplayed the diplomatic crisis,
   stating that the two nations "had that fight for 1,500 years", despite
   the fact that the Kashmir crisis started in 1947.^[105]^[106] United
   States Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that he is closely
   monitoring the situation after being advised by National Security
   Advisor of India Ajit Doval via phonecall after Operation
   Sindoor.^[107]

   On 10 May, a few days after Vice President JD Vance stated the conflict
   was "none of our business", President Trump first announced the
   ceasefire on social media, claiming the US had an active role in
   mediating the agreement.^[108]^[109] While Pakistan acknowledged
   American involvement, Indian officials maintained the agreement had
   been reached directly between the two countries.^[110]

   The Indian airstrikes targeted terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan,
   including a Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) camp in Bahawalpur. This camp was
   historically linked to the 2002 abduction and murder of Wall Street
   Journal reporter Daniel Pearl. The operation reportedly resulted in the
   death of Abdul Rauf Azhar, a senior JeM commander and brother of Masood
   Azhar, who was implicated in Pearl's beheading.^[111]^[112]^[113]

India

   The Government of India subsequently enacted a ban on several
   Pakistan-based YouTube channels for spreading provocative and
   communally sensitive content, as well as false narratives targeting the
   country, its Army, and security agencies, as well as a ban on Instagram
   accounts of several Pakistani celebrities.^[114]^[115]

   As of 8 May 2025, the escalation has caused significant disruptions in
   air travel across the region. India has closed 27 airports in its
   northern and western regions until 10 May, resulting in the
   cancellation of over 430 flights. Major Indian airlines, including Air
   India, IndiGo, and SpiceJet, have suspended operations to and from
   affected areas. International carriers such as Lufthansa, KLM,
   Singapore Airlines, and Thai Airways have rerouted flights to avoid
   Pakistani airspace, leading to longer travel times and delays on routes
   between Europe and Asia. Pakistan has also suspended flights from key
   airports, including Karachi, Lahore, and Sialkot, until further notice.
   The situation remains fluid, with both countries' airspaces
   experiencing closures and reroutings, impacting global aviation
   networks.^[116]^[117]

   In late July, more than two months after the actual crisis and
   subsequent four-day long conflict concluded, India's defence minister
   stated in an Indian parliament discussion that the military operations
   were halted only after it was ascertained by the Indian side that its
   political and military objectives were achieved, rejecting the claims
   made by U.S. President Donald Trump that he was part of
   mediation.^[118] On 29 July 2025, during a Lok Sabha debate, Prime
   Minister Narendra Modi asserted that no world leader had asked India to
   halt the military operation, dismissing suggestions of foreign
   intervention. Modi stated that the ceasefire, implemented on 10 May,
   followed a request from Pakistan and reiterated that India's actions
   were non-escalatory. He also revealed that U.S. Vice President JD Vance
   had attempted to contact him on the night of 9 May but was unable to
   reach him as Modi was in a meeting with the armed forces.^[119]

Pakistan

   In May 2025 a coalition of Pakistani actors including Adnan Siddiqui
   and Ghulam Mohiuddin called for peace talks, emphasising the urgent
   need for dialogue and understanding to foster harmony and resolve
   conflict.^[120]^[121]

Nepal

   On 9 May 2025, a peace group held a mass demonstration to demand
   peace.^[122]

China

   In July 2025, Chinese air force chief Lt. Gen. Wang Gang visited
   Pakistan to learn how Islamabad had used Chinese equipment to put
   together the "kill chain" for the Rafale.^[123]

Others

   The United Kingdom also issued a travel advisory warning in April 2025,
   mainly referring to the LoC.^[101] Members of the Indian diaspora
   protested outside the High Commission of Pakistan in
   London.^[124]^[125]

   The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom
   (USCIRF) Commissioner condemned the killing of Indian tourists in the
   Kashmir terrorist attack in April 2025 stating "We are deeply concerned
   by the explicit targeting of Hindus and other non-Muslims".^[126]

   China's Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, urged for de-escalation between the
   two countries.^[127] Bangladesh and UAE supported peace
   talks.^[128]^[129]

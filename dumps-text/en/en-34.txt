From One State of Emergency to Another - Emergency Powers in France

   2 years and less than 5 months after the end of the two-year state of
   emergency triggered on the wake of the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris,
   a brand new "state of health emergency" was activated in France on the
   23^rd March to cope with a new attack led, this time, by a small and
   invisible enemy, Covid-19. The so-called "state of health emergency"
   currently constitutes the legal framework and basis of the measures in
   force to cope with the epidemic, including nationwide lockdown. What is
   this new regime? Is it a threat to individual freedoms? What are its
   limits and guarantees? Was it legally necessary?

   The latter question is all the more relevant that the French legal
   playbook is far from being short of emergency powers regimes (1). It
   makes it all the more surprising that the French Government, at first,
   decided that it could act without triggering any of the textual regimes
   available (2) before making a complete U-turn and deciding that it
   needed a brand new emergency regime, dubbed "state of health emergency"
   (3).

1. Emergency Powers in France: A Quick Overview

1.1. The State of Siege

   The state of siege was originally based on two Acts of 1849 and 1878.
   It has been introduced in the French Constitution in 1958, at Article
   36:

     "The state of siege is decreed in the Council of Ministers. Its
     extension beyond twelve days can only be authorized by Parliament."

   The 1849 and 1878 Acts have been repealed and replaced by a 2004
   Ordinance (delegated legislation) which codified the state of siege in
   the Code of Defence. The triggering of the state of siege is subject to
   the existence of "imminent danger resulting from a foreign war or an
   armed insurrection." The state of siege is an emergency regime of a
   military nature: as soon as the state of siege is decreed, the powers
   with which the civilian authority is invested for the maintenance of
   order and police are transferred to the military authority. It has not
   been used in France since the second World War.

1.2. Article 16 of the French Constitution

   According to Article 16 of the French Constitution, where

     "the institutions of the Republic, the independence of the Nation,
     the integrity of its territory or the fulfilment of its
     international commitments are under serious and immediate threat,
     and where the proper functioning of the constitutional public
     authorities is interrupted",

   the President of the Republic "shall take measures required by these
   circumstances", including measures on matters which are ordinarily
   reserved to the Parliament. There is no substantial limitation apart
   from the requirement that they "shall be designed to provide the
   constitutional public authorities as swiftly as possible, with the
   means to carry out their duties", which is extremely vague.

1.3. The State of Emergency

   The State of Emergency Act has been adopted by the French Parliament on
   the 3^rd April 1955. It has been activated several times during the
   Algerian war (1955, 1958, 1961), secessionist movements in New
   Caledonia (1984), riots in the suburbs of Paris (2005) and, finally,
   following the terrorist attacks in Paris (2015) until the 1^st November
   2017. Activating the state of emergency implies the existence of an
   "imminent danger resulting from serious breaches of public order or
   events which, because of their nature or severity, constitute public
   calamities". The state of emergency is declared by decree in the
   Council of Ministers (i.e. signed by the President of the Republic). It
   cannot be extended beyond twelve days without the authorization of the
   Parliament.

   As for the prerogatives that the Administration has under the State of
   Emergency, listing all of them would exceed the size limit of the
   present text. Let us just say a few things. First, the Government does
   not necessarily activate all of them, and not necessarily on the whole
   of French territory. Second, the prerogatives allowed under the State
   of Emergency are extremely far-reaching and constitute a potential
   threat to liberties.

1.4. The Exceptional Circumstances Doctrine

   The exceptional circumstances doctrine is not a textual but a
   jurisprudential regime. It appeared, under the name of "war powers
   doctrine", in two rulings related to the circumstances of World War I
   (Council of State, 28 June 1918, Heyriès and Council of State, 28
   February 1919, Dol et Laurent). According to this doctrine, in the
   presence of exceptional circumstances (for example war, insurrection or
   natural disaster), a decision or action of the administration which
   would normally be considered illegal can be considered legal if a) the
   administration has been unable, due to exceptional circumstances, to
   act in accordance with the law b) it acted in consideration of an
   essential public interest and c) the breach of the principle of
   legality is proportionate to the other interests at stake.
   Administrative courts assess these conditions on a case-by-case basis.

2. The First Measures Against the Epidemic: A Combination of Health Emergency
Police and Exceptional Circumstances Doctrine

   The first measures both restrictive for the general public and related
   to the Covid-19 crisis were adopted by the Health Minister on the basis
   of Article L3131-1 of the Public Health Code ("Code de la Santé
   Publique", hereafter CSP). On the basis of this power, usually referred
   to as "health emergency police", the Health Minister adopted the
   Ministerial Decree of 14^th March 2020, which prohibited public access
   to a certain number of establishments open to the public (shopping
   centres, restaurants, cinemas, theatres, museums, etc.), banned any
   gathering, meeting or activity bringing together more than 100 people
   in a closed or open environment and prohibited the access of users to
   childcare establishments and educational and higher education
   establishments.

   As soon as the 16^th March, the nationwide lockdown was decided, and
   put into effect on the next day at noon. Since then, it is prohibited
   for every person to move outside their home, except for one of the
   listed reasons. People wishing to benefit from one of these exceptions
   must provide a "self-permission" document certifying that the trip in
   question falls within the scope of one of these exceptions. This
   lockdown was decided by Governmental Decree 2020-260, signed by the
   Prime Minister, the Health Minister and the Minister of Home Affairs.
   The legal basis of this Decree was, again, Article L3131-1 CSP, which
   was not legally orthodox since, as we have seen, this provision vests
   powers in the Health Minister and not the Prime Minister. This
   deviation from the text, together with the obvious far-reaching effects
   of a nationwide lockdown, probably explains why the Decree also
   mentioned the exceptional circumstances doctrine ("Given the
   exceptional circumstances arising from the covid-19 epidemic") in its
   recitals. However, this mention was itself somehow unorthodox since it
   is for the judge, and no one else, to decide whether such circumstances
   exist and justify the decision. New exceptions were added by the
   Governmental Decree 2020-279 of 19th March.

   It appears therefore that governmental authorities have found all the
   legal bases they needed to adopt all the measures they deemed required
   by the circumstances. Yet, the Government felt the necessity to create
   a new emergency regime: the state of health emergency.

3. The Enactment of a New Emergency Regime: The State of Health Emergency

3.1. Overview

   The Emergency Response to the Covid-19 Epidemic Act (2020-290), adopted
   under the accelerated legislative procedure on the 23^rd March 2020,
   contains various measures designed to cope with the epidemic. However,
   I would like to focus here on articles 1 to 8 of the Act. These
   provisions create a new emergency regime, called "state of health
   emergency." This regime is codified in the Public Health Code (CSP) at
   Art. L. 3131-14 to Art. L. 3131-12.

   According to the new Art. L3131-12 CSP, "the state of health emergency
   can be declared (...) in the event of a health disaster endangering, by
   its nature and gravity, the health of the population." The new regime
   does not replace the health emergency police of Art. L3131-1 (see
   above) but complements it.

   According to Art. L3131-15, in the territorial districts where the
   state of health emergency is declared, the Prime Minister can, by
   regulatory decree taken on the report of the Minister in charge of
   health, for the sole purpose of guaranteeing public health:
    1. Restrict or prohibit the movement of people and vehicles;
    2. Prohibit people from leaving their homes, subject to travel
       strictly essential for family or health needs;
    3. Order measures having as their object the quarantine of persons
       likely to be affected;
    4. Order measures for placing and keeping in isolation the affected
       persons;
    5. Order the temporary closure of one or more categories of
       establishments open to the public as well as meeting places, with
       the exception of establishments providing essential goods or
       services;
    6. Limit or prohibit gatherings on public pathways as well as meetings
       of any kind;
    7. Order the requisition of all goods and services necessary for the
       fight against the health catastrophe as well as of any person
       necessary for the functioning of these services or for the use of
       these goods;
    8. Take temporary measures to control the prices of certain products;
    9. Take all measures to make available to patients appropriate
       medicines;
   10. As necessary, take by decree any other regulatory measure limiting
       the freedom of undertaking, for the sole purpose of ending the
       health disaster.

   On the same day, Governmental Decree 2020-293 was adopted on the basis
   of this provision. For the most part, it rolls over, with even further
   restrictions, the content of the two previous lockdown Decrees
   (2020-260 and 2020-279 - see above).

3.2. Procedure and Parliamentary Oversight

   As the name of the regime suggests, the state of health emergency
   mimics the "normal" state of emergency, especially from the procedural
   point of view. For example, according to Art. L3131-13, "the state of
   health emergency is declared by decree in the Council of Ministers"
   (i.e. presidential Decree), just like the "normal" state of emergency.

   However, Art. 4 of the Act states that

     "by way of derogation from the provisions of article L. 3131-13 of
     the public health code, a state of health emergency is declared for
     a period of two months from the entry into force of this Act".

   Thus, in the present circumstances, the state of health emergency has
   been declared by the Act itself and not a presidential decree.

   Also, just like the "normal" state of emergency, the state of health
   emergency foresees the involvement of the Parliament. For example,
   according to Art. L3131-13 para 1,

     "the National Assembly and the Senate are informed without delay of
     the measures taken by the Government under the state of health
     emergency" and they "may request any additional information in the
     context of the control and evaluation of these measures."

   However, and for no clear or convincing reason, this involvement of the
   Parliament is, in certain respects, more limited than under the
   "normal" state of emergency. For example, according to Art. L3131-13
   para 3, the extension of the state of health emergency must be
   authorised by the Parliament beyond one month - as opposed to twelve
   days for the "normal" state of emergency. Other difference: whereas
   article 4 of the State of Emergency Act 1955 provides that the Act of
   Parliament extending the state of emergency lapses at the end of a
   period of fifteen days following the date of resignation of the
   Government or dissolution of the National Assembly, there is no such
   caducity for the state of health emergency. Therefore, if a newly
   elected Assembly wants to stop the state of health emergency, it has to
   adopt an Act for this purpose.

   The state of health emergency, like the state of emergency, stops at
   the date foreseen by the Parliament in the Act of extension. However,
   according to Art. L3131-14 para 2,

     "the state of health emergency may be terminated by decree in the
     Council of Ministers before the expiration of the period fixed by
     the Act extending it."

3.3. Judicial Review

   Since the decree declaring the "normal" state of emergency is subject
   to judicial review (Council of State, 24 March 2006, Rolin and
   Boisvert), it is likely that the decree declaring the "state of health
   emergency" is too, at least until it is extended by an Act of
   Parliament. However, in the present circumstances, the state of health
   emergency has been declared by the Act itself (Art. 4), therefore
   barring without necessity any judicial challenge of the declaration
   itself, except possibly through constitutional review. By analogy again
   with the state of emergency (Council of State, 9 December 2005,
   Allouache), both the termination of the state of health emergency by
   decree and the refusal by the Government to terminate the state of
   health emergency before the term determined by the Parliament are
   probably also subject to judicial review. However, available precedents
   concerning the state of emergency (See Allouache) suggest a minimum
   judicial review, limited to "manifest" violation of the law in
   maintaining it into force (and probably also, conversely, in
   terminating it).

   Measures adopted under the state of emergency are themselves subject to
   judicial review. How thorough this judicial review may be remains to be
   seen, but one may have certain causes for concern.

   If we assume that the intensity of the judicial review on measures
   adopted under the state of health emergency will be the same as the one
   on "normal" state of emergency measures, it is necessary to keep in
   mind that the latter has raised multiple criticisms. Furthermore, in
   the current circumstances, the Council of State has not so far proven a
   fierce guardian of individual freedoms.

   First, on the 22^nd March 2020, upon an application from a doctors
   union for interim measures, it ordered the Government to consider
   aggravating the existing lockdown measures and in particular "review
   the maintenance of the exemption for "short trips, near the home"
   taking into account major public health stakes of the confinement
   order."

   Second, consulted on the Act when it was only a bill, the Council of
   State made several suggestions to aggravate the state of health
   emergency by comparison with the "normal" state of emergency. It is for
   example the Council of State which suggested (para 17 of its opinion)
   to depart from the 12-day deadline for involving the Parliament in
   favour of a 1-month deadline and to suppress the caducity of the Act
   extending the state of health emergency if the Government resigns or if
   the national Assembly is dissolved. It even went as far (para 18 of its
   opinion) as suggesting the suppression of the provision imposing on the
   Government the transmission to the Parliament of information relating
   to the implementation of the state of health emergency - a suggestion
   which was fortunately not followed by the Government.

   In these circumstances, one may be forgiven not to completely trust
   administrative courts in general, and the Council of State in
   particular, to be thorough defenders of public liberties.

Emergency Lockdown Preparation

   Stay prepared for emergency lockdown situations at school. Learn how to
   ensure your child's safety and access to supplies and food in case of a
   lockdown.

   As parents, you know that diabetes management is 24/7. The safety and
   health of your child at school depends on access to care, diabetes
   supplies and equipment. While no one wants the need for a school
   emergency plan to ever be put into action, it is important to work with
   your child's school to develop a plan for how your child's diabetes
   needs will be managed in the rare, horrific event of a school emergency
   or lockdown. Practice emergency drills are becoming the norm in
   schools.

   However, in the unlikely event of a lockdown situation where students
   need to stay in place in the gym, playground, library, classroom or
   other area of the school, it is important to take a few steps to make
   sure your child will have access to needed supplies and food. Schools
   must provide access to care, even in the event of an emergency. While
   there is no way to perfectly and completely prepare for every
   situation, proper and practical planning can help to make sure your
   child is safe as possible.

   Do your homework. Find out if your child's school or school district
   has a policy for lock-down and emergency evacuations and what
   provisions have been included for addressing the needs of students with
   chronic illness. Knowing this policy will enable you to better prepare
   for a practice drill or a real-life emergency situation. Where are your
   child's supplies kept so that your child will always have access? Will
   your child need to stay in place or will all the children be sent to a
   central location? What happens if your child is enroute to the
   restroom, the clinic or in another area away from diabetes supplies?

   Identification. It is important that your child wear medical jewelry or
   some other item so that first responders and emergency workers can
   identify your child as having diabetes. Having visible identification
   will increase the chance of your child getting the care he or she needs
   as quickly as possible.

   Education and awareness for teachers and school staff. All school staff
   who have responsibility for your child should understand diabetes -
   including knowing signs of hypoglycemia and how to get help. In
   addition, these school staff should know where your child's supplies
   and food are kept and know how to access in the event of an emergency
   or lockdown.

   Possible considerations for supplies. Ideally, your child should always
   have access to his or meter, insulin, food, water and the restroom.
   Unfortunately, even the best made plans may be altered in the event of
   a school emergency. Parents should make sure a carbohydrate containing
   food and water is available to the child at all times. Water is
   important to prevent dehydration that can occur with hyperglycemia.
   This may mean that arrangements are made with the school to make sure
   food and water are kept in the classroom and other areas of the school
   the child may frequent to the best of the school's ability in any given
   emergency situation. If your child is independent in his or her
   management, a meter may be kept with your child at all times or in the
   teacher's desk or somewhere else in the classroom.

   Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). A quick-acting carbohydrate such as
   glucose tabs or a juice box should be always kept in the classroom or
   kept with the student at all times to swiftly treat hypoglycemia.

   Insulin. Children with type 1 diabetes and some children with type 2
   need access to their insulin. While the safest practice would be to
   have insulin always accessible, this may be difficult in a lockdown
   situation. If insulin is not available, the plan should be to reduce
   food intake and increase intake of water or non-carbohydrate containing
   liquids. It is important to know the school's plan for accessing
   medication in the event of a rare lockdown or evacuation.

   Written plans and school protocols. It is important to include a
   lockdown/emergency provision in your child's Section 504 Plan or
   Individualized Education Program (IEP). Work with your child's school
   or school district to come up with a safe and practical plan that can
   be incorporated in its lockdown/emergency evacuations protocols and
   easily implemented in the event it is needed.

What is a Soft Lockdown?

Answering Your Questions About Key School Safety Strategies

   School safety is a top priority for administrators, staff, and families
   alike. With active shooter incidents being a growing concern for
   schools, creating a secure learning environment has never been more
   crucial.

   Effective school safety requires comprehensive planning, clear
   protocols, and effective safety measures. In this blog, weâll explore
   the different types of lockdowns commonly used in schoolsâsoft
   lockdowns, hard lockdowns, and code red lockdownsâalong with their
   purposes and implementation guidelines. Additionally, weâll discuss
   common school safety issues and provide solutions, highlighting ALICE
   TrainingÂ® and Preparation & Response Training as proactive approaches
   to enhancing school safety.

What is a Soft Lockdown?

   A soft lockdown is a precautionary lockdown used when there is no
   immediate threat inside the school, but there may be potential risks in
   the vicinity, such as police activity or other security concerns.
   During a soft lockdown, access to the school is restricted, and
   students remain indoors, continuing their activities with additional
   security measures. School administrators and staff monitor the
   situation closely, and external doors are typically locked to limit
   access from the outside.

Benefits of Soft Lockdowns:

     * Allows students and teachers to continue classes with minimal
       disruption.

     * Prevents unauthorized access to the school while maintaining a
       calm, secure environment.

     * Enables staff to quickly upgrade to a hard lockdown if the threat
       level increases.

Soft Lockdown vs. Hard Lockdown: Key Differences

   While a soft lockdown is generally precautionary, a hard lockdown is
   implemented when there is an immediate threat to safety on school
   grounds, such as an active shooter or a violent intruder. In a hard
   lockdown, teachers and students follow strict protocols to minimize
   visibility and movement, locking doors, turning off lights, and hiding.
   This level of lockdown is designed to protect the school community from
   immediate danger.

   In summary:
     * Soft Lockdown: For potential external threats, students and staff
       remain in classrooms without high restrictions.

     * Hard Lockdown: For immediate internal threats, students and staff
       secure themselves in hidden, locked areas.

   ALICE TrainingÂ® from Navigate360 provides options-based response
   training to enhance lockdown procedures, empowering teachers and
   students with proactive strategies such as evacuation or barricading,
   depending on the situation.

What is a Code Red Lockdown?

   A code red lockdown is the highest level of lockdown, often associated
   with active shooter situations. This protocol signals an urgent threat
   to life and requires everyone to take cover, barricade themselves, and
   remain silent. Communication between law enforcement and school
   administrators is critical during a code red lockdown to ensure a
   coordinated response.

Should You Use Color Codes in Emergencies?

   Schools sometimes use color codes like code red, code yellow, or code
   blue in school to designate different types of lockdowns or
   emergencies. However, ALICE TrainingÂ® does not recommend using color
   systems for emergency alerts. It is preferable for everyone involved to
   communicate specific, descriptive information. For example, describing
   the location and appearance of an intruder helps everyone respond more
   effectively. Vague color codes can lead to confusion, especially for
   visitors or substitute staff who may not remember specific color
   meanings.

   Descriptive information, such as âthe intruder is in the north hallway
   wearing a red jacket,â ensures that everyone knows exactly where the
   threat is, adding an additional layer of safety by informing the
   intruder that their location is known.

Common School Safety Issues & Solutions

   Schools face a range of safety challenges, from external security
   threats to internal behavioral issues. Addressing these effectively
   involves a blend of physical safety measures, behavioral management
   strategies, and strong access control.

1. Managing Access to School Grounds

   Uncontrolled access to school facilities can pose significant risks.
   Schools should secure all entry points and implement access control
   systems that restrict unauthorized entry. These systems may include:
     * Metal Detectors: Screening devices at main entrances to detect
       prohibited items and enhance school security.

     * Visitor Management Solutions: Tools to monitor, record, and
       restrict visitors, ensuring only authorized personnel access the
       school grounds.

   Navigate360 Visitor Management solution provides comprehensive
   screening, approving, and tracking capabilities schools use to control
   and monitor access in real-time. Learn more about the key benefits of a
   visitor management system here.

2. Implementing Conflict Resolution & De-Escalation Training

   Behavioral issues among students are common in schools and can escalate
   into conflicts. Schools can address this through conflict resolution
   and de-escalation training, equipping staff with skills to detect and
   diffuse aggression effectively.

   Navigate360 Preparation & Response Training includes courses on
   de-escalation and conflict resolution, supporting a calm, respectful
   school atmosphere that benefits the entire school community.

3. Enhancing Emergency Response Through ALICE TrainingÂ®

   Active shooter incidents are among the most serious threats schools may
   face, necessitating specialized training. Traditional lockdowns are not
   sufficient in the face of an active shooter. ALICE TrainingÂ® (Alert,
   Lockdown, Inform, Counter, Evacuate) offers a modern, trauma-informed
   approach to active shooter preparedness. Rather than relying solely on
   traditional lockdowns, ALICE provides options to evacuate, barricade,
   or counter depending on the situation.

   By training staff and students in ALICE strategies, schools can empower
   individuals to participate actively in their own safety, ensuring a
   more resilient school community.

4. Managing Active Shooter & Other Emergency Drills with Emergency Management
Solutions

   In addition to ALICE TrainingÂ®, regular active shooter drills are
   essential to ensure that staff and students are familiar with protocols
   and prepared to act swiftly during a crisis. Conducting these drills
   safely and effectively requires careful coordination and tracking,
   especially to meet compliance requirements.

   Emergency Management solutions assist schools in managing and
   organizing not only active shooter drills but all required safety
   drills, such as fire and evacuation drills. EM tools provide
   centralized tracking and reporting features that help schools stay
   compliant with state and district regulations, ensuring that drills are
   conducted on schedule and documented accurately. This proactive
   approach enables schools to maintain readiness and confidently
   demonstrate compliance, supporting a safer and more prepared school
   community.

5. Addressing Mental Health & Student Well-Being

   A positive learning environment goes beyond physical safety and
   includes emotional well-being. Common issues like bullying, anxiety,
   and stress can affect a studentâs mental health and overall school
   experience. Schools can implement social-emotional learning (SEL)
   programs and counseling services to support student well-being.

   Navigate360 SEL and Mental Health & Prevention curriculum provide
   structured programs that address the unique needs of todayâs students,
   fostering resilience and encouraging positive interactions.

Building a Layered, Holistic Approach to School Safety

   A multi-layered approach to school safety integrates physical security
   measures, crisis response training, mental health support, and
   structured emergency management. Essential safety strategies include
   security technology (like access control, surveillance, and metal
   detectors), crisis response training for active shooter scenarios and
   de-escalation, mental health programs to boost resilience, and regular,
   compliant emergency drills.

   By implementing ALICE TrainingÂ® and Preparation & Response Training,
   schools prepare staff and students to respond effectively to
   emergencies, creating a safe, supportive learning environment.
   Together, these comprehensive strategies equip schools to handle modern
   challenges confidently, fostering a secure atmosphere where every
   member of the school community feels protected and valued.

Paris lockdown leaves streets stuck in 1942 for abandoned film set

   interrupts filming

   Residents confined to their homes in a corner of northern Paris have
   been plunged back to one of the darkest moments of the cityâs past.

   Two streets â Rue Berthe and Rue Androuet â in Montmartre in the shadow
   of the SacrÃ©-Coeur basilica have been left in a timewarp of the Nazi
   occupation after they were returned to 1942 for a film set.

   The film-makers were forced to abandon the set when France went into
   coronavirus lockdown, leaving the streets with fake facades for corset
   shops, tailors, a shoe repairer and mirror-maker, and dotted with war
   propaganda, anti-communist tracts and signs in German.

   The film, Adieu Monsieur Haffmann, directed by Fred CavayÃ©, is an
   adaptation of an award-winning play telling the story of Joseph
   Haffmann, a Jewish jeweller in Paris at the start of the war who is
   forced to hide in the cellar of his shop as the Nazis take over the
   city.

   Described as a black comedy, the film stars Daniel Auteuil, who despite
   dozens of international films to his name including 1999âs The Lost
   Son, is still best remembered for his role in the 1980s films Jean de
   Florette with GÃ©rard Depardieu and Manon des Sources, with Emmanuelle
   BÃ©art. The film is due out next year and the set was supposed to have
   been dismantled last weekend.

   Instead, it provides an eerie reminder of a bygone era when the streets
   were similarly deserted by many in fear of the German occupiers. A sign
   in the window of the fake pharmacy: âDear customers, because of a lack
   of deliveries certain articles are out of stockâ, is an example of life
   imitating art imitating life.

   Paris was occupied by Nazi Germany from 14 June 1940 until 24 August
   1944. The puppet French state under Marshal Philippe PÃ©tain relocated
   to Vichy, while Gen Charles de Gaulle organised the Free French and
   Resistance forces from London. During Nazi control of the city, French
   police rounded up Jews who were sent to the death camps.

   Meanwhile, the nightclubs of Montmartre remained open, profiting from a
   new clientele of German officers and soldiers, while night-time brought
   black marketeers on to the â streets.

   Tim McInerney, a university lecturer in British and Irish cultural
   history in Paris and co-host of the Irish Passport podcast, tweeted:
   âJust in case quarantined Paris wasnât disorientating enough: my
   neighbourhood was being used as a film set when the lockdown hit. Now
   the whole block has been left frozen in 1941â.

   He later said: âParis is of course haunted by the legacy of the
   occupation. Thereâs a school down the road that has a plaque telling
   you how many Jewish children were deported.

   âThe dark shadows are already there so to recreate it is quite
   unsettling, even more so as a lot of things written on the posters are
   happening right now. One poster [from the film set] said everyone must
   keep off the streets between 11.30m and 4am, which seemed a little
   close to home as just before Iâd had to show my permit [to be outside]
   to the police. Itâs a strange situation.â

   He said parts of the film set had been pillaged and ripped down by
   souvenir hunters.

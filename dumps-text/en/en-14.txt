China Covid: The politics driving the hellish lockdowns

   The world has largely moved on from Covid - except for China, where
   towns and cities are still shut down overnight.

   And that's unlikely to change soon, judging by President Xi Jinping's
   opening speech at the Communist Party Congress on Sunday. China - and
   even the world - was hoping for a hint of relaxation. But Mr Xi, who is
   set to be handed a historic third term to lead the Party, said that the
   government would not "waver" in its commitment to record zero cases.

   Driven by Mr Xi's approval, China's lockdowns have been incessant,
   unpredictable and hellish by most accounts. They have sparked food
   shortages, crippled healthcare access, hit the economy hard and even
   spurred rare signs of protest.

   But Beijing has clung to zero-Covid, which has come to define Mr Xi's
   rule and the authoritarian bureaucracy at his disposal like almost no
   other policy.

Confuse or convince?

   The BBC found that since March, China has partially or fully locked
   down 152 prefecture-level cities, affecting a population of more than
   280 million. But 114 of those have been locked down just since August,
   as the Party Congress approached.

   Beijing is the only major city to have avoided a full lockdown so far.
   Residents half-jokingly observe that the capital has managed this by
   locking down the rest of the country when needed. However on Thursday
   some housing estates and shopping centres in Beijing were being locked
   down after a steep rise in cases.

   BBC gathered data starting in March because that's when China's fourth
   phase of Covid control measures kicked off - comparing lockdowns across
   phases is harder because official language changes, skewing definitions
   and therefore, the corresponding data.

   And China's bureaucrats have certainly found inventive new ways to
   describe lockdowns. The measures had become so controversial and
   dreaded that confusing official-speak was one way to make them more
   palatable.

   So they used phrases like "stasis management", "at-home stillness" or
   to be clearer, "stillness throughout the whole region" or "stop all
   unnecessary movement".

   Then came "temporary societal control", which authorities said was not
   a "lockdown" but reduced movement that somehow would not affect the
   "normal order of production and life". And yet "the public was asked
   not to go out unless necessary".

   "Enclosed management" was another new phrase invented in the southern
   province of Guangdong. It means that the village, district or
   residential compound is enclosed, with checkpoints at entrances and
   exits. People and vehicles are allowed to enter and leave with passes.
   People who do not live or work in the enclosed area are not allowed to
   enter. But, residents were told, it's not a lockdown.

   When track-and-trace methods started to grate, eager officials came up
   with an alternative: "temporal and spatial overlapper". The
   sci-fi-inspired phrase refers to someone whose location, tracked by
   their phone, has overlapped in time and space with someone else who is
   Covid-positive.

   Rather than tell people not to visit their hometowns during this year's
   Spring Festival, the governor in Dancheng County in central Henan
   province warned them that "those who come home with malicious intent
   will first be quarantined, then be detained".

   Now China is in what Beijing calls the "scientific and precise dynamic
   zero" phase, whose meaning no-one seems to be sure about. It's meant to
   be one step up from the earlier "dynamic zero" policy.

   Dynamic because the idea is that it's not just about locking down
   entire cities and towns but about responding more dynamically depending
   on what the situation requires. But on the ground, it just looks and
   feels like a series of endless lockdowns.

   The year began with the tourist hub of Xi'an, home to 13 million, being
   shut down for a month. Then in March, a lockdown was announced in
   Shanghai. It was meant to last less than a week, but its 25 million
   residents stayed home for two months. In September, residents in locked
   down Chengdu found themselves trapped in their apartments during an
   earthquake. Elsewhere, rescue workers were required to do a Covid test
   before they could save anyone.

   Chengdu was among several cities where a lockdown caused food shortages

   That same month, hundreds of thousands of people in two cities in
   Shanxi faced a lockdown without a single case being reported: officials
   said it was to "contain the risk from outside". A local party leader
   vowed to protect the area "to welcome the 20th Party Congress with
   excellent results".

Pleasing Mr Xi

   Beijing has repeatedly insisted that "dynamic zero" means local
   authorities must not resort to a "one size fits all" approach of full
   lockdowns and mass testing.

   But there appears to be a discrepancy between that diktat and what's
   actually happening in towns and cities across China. Several lockdowns
   announced by local officials were, in fact, missing from Beijing's
   daily announcements in March and April - including one in Shenzhen
   which confined 17 million to their homes for a week.

   It's possible central government officials did not want to encourage
   total lockdowns by drawing attention to them, while local officials
   preferred to use them to control outbreaks swiftly.

   Experts also say China's bureaucracy is far more centralised under Mr
   Xi - it's a reversal of the decentralisation that began after China
   introduced economic reforms. What that means now is that bureaucrats
   enforce Mr Xi's signature policies with zeal.

   "Xi's appetite for adaptive governance and his relationship with local
   authorities varies by issue areas," says Yuen Yuen Ang, a political
   science associate professor at the University of Michigan.

   "On his signature policies, those he declared as having no room for
   'wavering', there is little or no leeway for local governments to make
   adjustments. Indeed, to survive and get ahead, they must over-implement
   Xi's personal edicts with gusto, even if the net result is damaging."

   From April onwards, the lockdown tallies in Beijing's announcements
   matched those in local notices - around the same time Mr Xi reaffirmed
   his support for sticking to a zero-Covid approach. As the year wore on,
   more cities stopped meticulous track-and-trace and entered full
   lockdowns even if only a handful of cases were reported.

   Local officials are driven by both fear of punishment and an urge to
   display loyalty to Mr Xi, says Wu Guoguang, a senior China scholar at
   Stanford University. He was once a member of the Chinese Communist
   Party's policy group on political reform.

   When it comes to proving their loyalty, Mr Wu adds: "There is an
   undeclared competition among local leaders, which provides a huge
   momentum to their seemingly unreasonable measures."

It's all political

   And, experts say, it's no coincidence that the lockdowns started to
   spread as the congress approached.

   China that have entered lockdown each week between 1 March and 12
   October 2022. There has been a measurable increase in city lockdowns
   since August.

   "Covid is political in China," says William Hurst, professor of Chinese
   development at Cambridge University.

   The carefully scripted once-in-five-years party congress carries
   special import this year - if it goes according to Mr Xi's plan, he
   becomes the first leader since the first Communist-era leader Mao
   Zedong to serve as party boss for a third term. And nothing can ruin
   the party quite like a Covid outbreak - especially since Mr Xi and his
   bureaucrats insist "dynamic zero" is a success that has been saving
   lives.

   It has indeed prevented a major outbreak like the one in Shanghai
   earlier this year, says Benjamin Cowling, chair of epidemiology at the
   University of Hong Kong. "What is less certain is whether the cost is
   justified, and whether this approach is going to be sustainable given
   its enormous economic costs," he adds.

   Locking down millions of people may be helping keep national case
   counts low, but the decision to do so even as the rest of the world
   opens up also shows how poorly prepared China is for a post-Covid
   world.

   cases in mainland China by week between 28 February and the week
   beginning 10 October 2022. A spring peak has tailed off significantly

   Public health experts argue that if zero-Covid was indeed about saving
   lives, Beijing would have implemented a more vigorous vaccine policy
   like other countries. But China has refused to import vaccines despite
   evidence that its homemade jabs haven't proved as effective. And
   unvaccinated elderly people, who Beijing says it's trying to protect
   with zero-Covid, have died from the virus.

   But what zero-Covid has done, experts say, is project a veneer of
   control and stability as the year's biggest political event unfolds.

   Prof Hurst expects the intermittent lockdowns to last at least until
   March next year, when China's equivalent of parliament convenes to
   choose Mr Xi as president for a third time.

   "Lockdowns prevent Covid outbreaks from spreading," Prof Hurst adds.
   "But they also exert incredibly strict social control."

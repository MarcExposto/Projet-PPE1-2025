   Israeli forces imposed a lockdown on a Palestinian village in the
   occupied West Bank Saturday, their second day of operations there after
   a local resident killed two people in Israel.

   "The IDF (Israeli army) is operating forcefully against terror hubs in
   the village of Qabatiya ... accompanied by a lockdown and a complete
   cordon around the locality," Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a
   statement published by his office on Saturday.

   "We will continue to pursue an uncompromising offensive policy against
   Palestinian terror," he added.

   Bilal Hunaisha, a resident of Qabatiya, south of Jenin in the northern
   West Bank, said the town "is being subjected to collective punishment
   by the Israeli occupation."

   "As you can see, they blocked the way to my house and I am no longer
   able to move around," he told Agence France-Presse, pointing to a pile
   of rubble obstructing the road. In the attack on Friday a 34-year-old
   Palestinian man killed two people in northern Israel.

   The assailant, who had been working illegally in Israel, had used his
   employer's vehicle to ram into a 68-year-old man and then stabbed an
   18-year-old girl to death, according to Israeli police.

   A few hours later, the Israeli army and the Shin Bet domestic security
   agency began operating in Qabatiya. They searched the perpetrator's
   house and questioned suspects, the army said.

   On Saturday, the army's Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir ordered the
   reinforcement of troops deployed in the area.

   "This period is characterised by lone attackers and individuals staying
   illegally in (Israel). Enforcement against those who transport and
   employ them must be strengthened and improved," he said, according to
   an army statement.

   "At the same time, we must continue to enhance our capabilities to
   identify and thwart these attackers." Qabatiya resident Muhannad
   Zakarneh told AFP that the army arrested him at home at 6 am "for no
   obvious reasons" and kept him handcuffed for hours.

   "When I asked what my charge was, there was no response," he said.

   The official Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that besides
   blocking entrances and conducting interrogations and home searches,
   Israeli forces also took over a school and used it as a "detention and
   interrogation center."

   Since the start of the war in Gaza following Hamas' attack on Israel in
   October 2023, at least 38 people, including two foreigners, have been
   killed inside Israel in attacks by Palestinians, according to an AFP
   tally based on official Israeli figures.

   During the same period, violence has also surged in the West Bank,
   which Israel has occupied since 1967. Israeli troops and settlers have
   killed more than 1,000 Palestinians in the West Bank, including many
   militants as well as dozens of civilians, according to an AFP tally
   based on figures from the Palestinian Health Ministry.

   According to official Israeli figures, at least 44 Israelis, both
   soldiers and civilians, have been killed in Palestinian attacks or
   Israeli military operations in the same period in the West Bank. (AFP)

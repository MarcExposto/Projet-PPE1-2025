Strategies for managing lockdown

   Reading time: 3 min

   Coping with lockdown means adapting daily life to these new
   circumstances. This has a direct impact on different emotional aspects,
   restructuring and adapting new spaces, and suddenly absorbing new
   situations that are difficult to manage, amongst others.

   Professionals recommend a series of tips to help manage this situation
   as well as possible.

Emotional aspects

   When it comes to thoughts caused by this new situation and the
   information generated by it, you are advised to:
   Woman

   Accept the situation in order to maintain a good state of mind and to
   be calmer.
   Person with a questioner indicating cognitive impairment

   Remember the reasons behind the lockdown.
   Person with crossed-out TV, radio and mobile phone

   Avoid excessive consumption of information. Evaluate it and contrast
   it.
   A person who asks another person to repeat what he or she has said

   Avoid constantly talking about Covid-19.

   Emotions that are not generally recurrent, such as fear, uncertainty or
   frustration and that may now arise more often, should be accepted as a
   normal response to an abnormal situation. In this sense, it is
   advisable to support the people around you and stay in regular contact.

Behavioural aspects

   Fear is one of the emotions that runs highest when experiencing any
   situation of crisis, such as Covid-19. This causes behaviour to be
   impulsive instead of rational, meaning it is important to follow a
   series of recommendations in order to both recognise and accept the
   emotions, as well as to establish routines that are as similar to
   normal life as possible.
   Well-adapted building or house

   Follow the established safety measures.
   A person taking a shower

   Maintain healthy habits in terms of hygiene, food, exercise and sleep.
   Carrying out different activities

   Try to maintain the greatest number of basic routines.
   Person doing yoga

   Do enjoyable and relaxing activities that don't require going anywhere.

Working remotely

   Lockdown has meant many people have to work from home and must dedicate
   a space in their house to this. As far as is possible, professionals
   recommend:
   A living room with sofa, table and computer

   Setting up a space with the best possible conditions in terms of light,
   quietness and, if possible, not in your bedroom.
   Computer and book timetable

   Set boundaries between your work and personal life.
   A plate of chicken, cutlery and a clock: mealtimes

   Respect break times.
   Adult talking with a boy and a girl

   Inform those around you of when you are available for contact to
   prevent constant interruptions.

Losing important people

   An exceptional situation has arisen in the context of Covid-19. We are
   not able to accompany family members or other important people in the
   last moments of their lives, say goodbye or be at the side of those who
   need support at this time. For this reason, you are advised to carry
   out simple actions to symbolise a goodbye.

   If you need help to support you through this situation, you are
   recommended:
   Person doing yoga

   To try using resources such as relaxation techniques.
   Person touching another person's back, emotional support

   To find support from those closest to you.
   Patient talking to healthcare staff

   And, if necessary, to consult a mental health professional.

Lockdown and childhood

   Children have also had to reorganise their daily school,
   extracurricular activity and leisure routines. To help them cope with
   lockdown, you are advised to:
   Child asking questions to an adult

   Be attentive, answer children's questions and keep them well-informed.
   Adult who listens to and understands a child's concerns

   Listen to and validate their emotional experiences and their ways of
   adapting to the new situation.
   Form with ticked boxes in a folder

   Keep rules and boundaries clear, explicit and well defined.
   Daily routine including sleeping, reading, playing, and eating

   Prioritise routines.
   Adult and child sharing activities

   Share activities both in terms of household tasks, schoolwork and
   leisure.
   Family with father, son and daughter

   Let them participate in family decisions as much as possible.
   Two adults talking and communicating with a child

   Explain what the family situation (work and schedules) will be like
   during lockdown.
   Hand washing

   Help them to understand and follow safety measures.
   Sad mother and daughter talking to a loved one by video call

   If they want to, allow children to participate in alternative ways of
   saying goodbye to family members during lockdown.
   Two people in front of a computer and a clock

   Allow children to use electronic devices reasonably.

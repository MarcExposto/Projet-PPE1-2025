has attracted
attracted so
so much
much attention
attention and
and controversy
controversy as
as this
this decision
decision to
to grind
grind social
social and
and economic
economic life
life to
to a

was it
it the
the right
right thing
thing to
to do


properly evaluating
evaluating the
the effectiveness
effectiveness of
of any
any health
health oriented
oriented treatment
treatment be
be it
it a
a new
new medicine
medicine vaccine
vaccine or
lockdown
measure involves
involves comparing
comparing its
its introduction
introduction with
with a
a counterfactual
counterfactual situation
situation where
where everything
everything is
is the
the same
same except
except for
for what
what s
s being
being tested


this is
is why
why medical
medical trials
trials have
have a
a control
control group
group whose
whose members
members are
are given
given a
a placebo
placebo and
and whose
whose characteristics
characteristics match
match the
the testing
testing group
group as
as closely
closely as
as possible


unfortunately this
this isn
isn t
t possible
possible for
lockdowns


there are
are no
no directly
directly equivalent
equivalent parts
parts of
of a
a country
country or
or the
the world
world that
that can
can act
act as
as true
true test
test and
and control
control groups
groups and
and so
so no
no possibility
possibility of
of a
a controlled
controlled trial


instead researchers
researchers must
must resort
resort to
to other
other methods
methods to
to try
try to
to measure
lockdowns


mathematical models
models can
can be
be used
used to
to produce
produce "what
"what if"
if" scenarios
scenarios where
where applying

simulated to

work best
best essentially
essentially comparing

to other
other measures
measures or
or doing
doing nothing
nothing at
at all


such models
models are
are very
very useful
useful and
and have
have been
been used
used throughout
throughout the
the pandemic


however they
they ve
ve also
also been
been heavily
heavily criticised
criticised for
for their
their pessimistic
pessimistic predictions
predictions about
about the
the impact

of the

their outputs
outputs depend
depend on
on making
making assumptions
assumptions and
and estimates
estimates including
including about
about human
human behaviour
behaviour which
which is
is notoriously
notoriously difficult
difficult to
to capture
capture accurately


an alternative
alternative is
is to
to use
use a
a data
data driven
driven method
method that
that doesn
doesn t
t rely
rely so
so strongly
strongly on
on the
the assumptions

for example
example the
the "difference

difference" method
method compares

outcomes from

but otherwise
otherwise share
share many

but of
of course
course this
this runs
runs into
into our
our initial
initial problem


while often
often similar
similar no
no two
two states
states aren
aren t
t directly
directly comparable


and for
for other

countries like
like the
the uk

its even
even more
more difficult
difficult to
to find
find good
good pairings

for comparison


imperfect assessments

these difficulties

of researchers

have worked

while accepting

that no
no method

of assessment
assessment is
is perfect

this requires

lockdowns
